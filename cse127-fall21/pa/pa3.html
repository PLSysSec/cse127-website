    **PA 3: Library sandboxing (100 points)**

**Early Turn-In: Wednesday, November 4, 2020 by 11:59:59 PM (10% bonus)**

**Hard Deadline: Wednesday, November 4, 2020 by 11:59:59 PM Pacific Time**

The goal of this assignment is to gain hands-on experience with library
sandboxing---and exploiting sandboxed libraries using confused deputy attacks!
Specifically:

- You are provided a C++ application that uses a vulnerable, unsandboxed C library.  

- Your task is to (1) retrofit the application to run the library in a sandbox (without validating values from the sandbox), (2) turn a vulnerability in the sandboxed library into an application exploit, and (3) properly validate all data coming from the sandbox to prevent such exploitation.

As usual, you may collaborate but not discuss your solution with other students
until seven days after the assignment deadline.

# Getting Started

Download the [VM
image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15ifWoVBR3ZzfXRhCdf70Xi4Dz5hiS9oE/view?usp=sharing)
containing the application and library source code, as well as a Makefile that
will compile the library with and without sandboxing.

## Assignment Files

The `pa3` directory in VM contains several files and directories to get you
started:

- *The C library:* The `lib.c` and `lib.h` files are the source code for the
  library. Compiling the library will produce a shared library file `my_lib.so`.
  You will load this compiled library when creating the sandbox with the
  `create_sandbox()` method.

- *The C++ application:* The source for the application is in `app.cpp`.
  **This is the only file you will modify throughout this assignment.**

- *Build files:* The Makefile (which you should NOT modify) has two commands. The
  first, `app`, will attempt to compile the application with the library
  _unsandboxed_. Second, `app_sandboxed` will compile the application with the
  library sandboxed.  Note: Running `make app_sandboxed` will not successfully
  compile until you modify the application to sandbox the library.

- *Dependencies:* The `include` and `archive` directories contain files
  necessary for compiling the application with sandboxing. Do NOT modify these
  files.

You will submit the following files for the 3 parts of the assignment:

1. `sol1.cpp`: This is your first sandboxed version of `app.cpp`. The provided
   crashing inputs should not cause a segfault on this (now sandboxed)
   application.
2. `sol2.txt`: This should contain the command-line arguments to your
    now-sandboxed application (`sol1.cpp`) that causes the application to segfault.
    We will test it against our reference solution.
3. `sol3.cpp`: This will be your improved version of `sol1.cpp`, which
    addresses the confused deputy attack vector from step 2. Neither the original
    vulnerability, nor the vulnerability you exploite in part 2 should cause this
    version of the application to segfault. We will test your `sol3.cpp`
    against our reference solution to part 2.

Along with each of these files, you should also submit `writeup1.txt`,
`writeup2.txt`, and `writeup3.txt`, briefly explaining how you came to the
solution for each of the 3 parts.  In particular, for writeup2.txt, explicitly
explain why the arguments to the program cause the application to segfault even
though you sandboxed the library.


## Building the Project

Run `make bootstrap` before running any other `make` commands.
Run `make app` to build the unsandboxed application.
Run `make app_sandboxed` to build the sandboxed application (this will not build
until you have sandboxed the library).

# Building, Breaking, Building Better
## Part 1: Isolating the library

We have provided you with an application that uses a contrived hashing library.
Among other things, the application directly calls the `get_hash` library
function with command line arguments, and prints the resulting hash.  The first
argument is the string to hash and the second argument is the completion
message.

For example, after we build the application we can run it as such:

```
$./app "I love to hash strings" Completed!

VERSION: 1.0.0
Done: Completed!
Hash = 30162623

```

This library is buggy though, and as an attacker you feed the application---and,
in turn, the library---bad input that will cause it crash:

```
$ ./app AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA Completed!

VERSION: 1.0.0
Done: Completed!
[1]    4168 segmentation fault (core dumped)  ./app  Completed!
```

In part 1, you will modify `app.cpp` to isolate the library from the rest of
the application.  This will ensure that that the bug in the library cannot
directly compromise the host application.
To do this, you will be using the
RLBox sandboxing tool.

You will want to read the [RLBox documentation page](https://docs.rlbox.dev/)
and maybe even play with another [example sandboxed
library](https://github.com/PLSysSec/rlbox_sandboxing_api/tree/master/examples/hello-world-noop).
In the RLBox documentation and example, we use the noop-sandbox
(`rlbox_noop_sandbox`) as the sandbox type. For this assignment, you will use a
*real* sandbox. To this end, use `rlbox_lucet_sandbox` type.  In your `app.cpp`
you'll want to declare the sandbox as:

```
rlbox::rlbox_sandbox<rlbox::rlbox_lucet_sandbox> sandbox;
```

You don't need to include any special header files for this. We have included
all the necessary header files in `app.cpp`.

**Subtasks** We recommend tackling this part in several steps:

1. Create and destroy the sandbox in `main()`.
2. Wrap all library calls using `invoke_sandbox_function`. Remember that all
   inputs to sandboxed function calls must be tainted (e.g., the type of a tainted
   `char*` is `rlbox::tainted<char*,rlbox::rlbox_lucet_sandbox>`) and that all
   return values are tainted.
   You can find an example of a string being copied into the sandbox and being used as an input here: https://github.com/PLSysSec/rlbox_sandboxing_api/blob/master/examples/hello-world-noop/main.cpp#L36-L39 
3. Rewrite the `on_completion` callback---the function that is called by the
   library---to have type:

   ```
    void on_completion(rlbox::rlbox_sandbox<rlbox::rlbox_lucet_sandbox>& _,
                       rlbox::tainted<char*,rlbox::rlbox_lucet_sandbox> tainted_str);
   ```
   It would be unsafe for the sanboxed library to be able to call arbitrary
   functions in the application. So, you must also register this function so
   the library can call it via `register_callback`.
4. Test that the valid input above still gives the same result.
5. Test that the crashing input above does not crash the application.

*Note*: Since the library is isolated it won't be able to access pointers in
the application. For example, it can't access `argv[1]`. Instead you need to
allocate a buffer in the sandbox using `malloc_in_sandbox<T>()` and copy
values from the application into the library.

In this part of the assignment, you will need untaint values. To do this, use
the `UNSAFE_unverified()` method.

Once you have sandboxed the application and the crashing input no longer causes
the program to segfault, copy `app.cpp` to `sol1.cpp`; you will turn this in.

## Part 2: Using the isolated library to break the application

In part 1, you sandboxed the library so that a failure in the library cannot
directly compromise the host application. But what if the sandbox returns bad
data that then confuses the application into compromising itself?

In this part, you goal is to find a confused deputy vulnerability in your
application code that the compromised sandboxed library can use to compromise
the host application.  This is possible because in part 1 you used
`UNSAFE_unverified()` to untaint data coming from the sandbox.  This function
just removes the taint; it does not validate the data received by the library.

Once you find the vulnerability, your task is to craft arguments to the program
that can be used to crash the sandboxed application. In `sol2.txt`, you need to
just give us the arguments. For example, if `./app aaaa bbb` crashes, then
`sol2.txt` contents should only be `aaaa bbb`. (Make sure it's in this format
since we'll be automatically grading this.)

## Part 3: Isolating the library correctly

In part 3, you will improve your application by actually validating data copied
from the sandboxed library. If the library returns erroneous data, this input
validation should prevent the erroneous data from crashing or otherwise
compromising the host application. After you have completed this portion, you
will no longer use any `UNSAFE_unverified()` functions.

You will want to replace your calls to `UNSAFE_unverified()` with
`copy_and_verify` for tainted primitives (e.g., `long long`s) and
`copy_and_verify_string` for tainted string. You can find an example of a
verifier
[here](https://github.com/PLSysSec/rlbox_sandboxing_api/blob/master/examples/hello-world-noop/main.cpp#L29-L33)

Once you are done, copy `app.cpp` to `sol3.cpp`.

## Notes and hints

- Read the RLBox docs and example mentioned above.
- Invoking a sandbox function requires all of it's arguments to be tainted.
- You will need to change the type signature of `on_completion()`.
- When you create the sandbox you need to supply the path of the `.so` file,
  make sure to use `./mu_lib.so` instead of just `my_lib.so`.
- It is probably not a good idea to try to interpret the huge compiler errors
  that RLBox will throw at you. A better idea would be to look at your code and
  try to work out what values are tainted at which point.

# Submission

1. Create a directory.
2. Create a file named `PID` in this directory, and put your PID in it (ex: `A12345678`).
3. Add `sol1.cpp`, `sol2.txt`, and `sol3.cpp` to this directory.
4. Run the following command from the directory `tar -czvf pa3.tar.gz <dirname>`. 
   This will create a `pa3.tar.gz` with all your files in it.
   You can see what files were zipped by running `tar -tf pa3.tar.gz`.
5. Submit `pa3.tar.gz` via gradescope.

Note: The autograder expects the above file names. It also expects `sol2.txt`
to be correctly formatted ad described above. We will use your writeups for
partial credit.
