    **PA 1:  GDB + x86 (20 pts)**

**Early turn-in:** Monday, October 12, 2020 by 23:59:59 PDT (10% bonus)

**Hard deadline:** Wednesday, October 14, 2020 by 23:59:59 PDT

# Goal

The goal of this assignment is to become familiar with the setup that will be used for future
assignments, such as the use of a virtual machine and the included turn-in script, as well as the
basics of working with gdb and writing programs in x86 assembly.

# Getting Started

To complete this assignment, you are provided with a VirtualBox VM
pre-populated with the assignment files.

## VM Image

In order to match the environment in which your submission will be graded, all work for this
assignment must be done on the VirtualBox VM we provide, named `pa1box`. You can download the VM
image [**here**](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1_BnDzeOYWvbNUxZ3c-XSIxrIyN-sx4Lg&export=download).

The VM is configured with two users: `student`, with password `hacktheplanet`; and `root`, with
password `hackallthethings`. The VM is configured with SSH on port 2222. Please note that SSH is
disabled for `root`, so you can only SSH in as the `student` user. You can still log in as `root`
using `su` or by logging into the VM directly.

To SSH into the VM:

```
ssh -p 2222 student@127.0.0.1
```

To copy files from your computer to the VM:

```
scp -P 2222 -r /path/to/files/ student@127.0.0.1:/home/student
```

To copy files from the VM to your computer:

```
scp -P 2222 student@127.0.0.1:/path/to/files/ /destination/path
```

## VM on M1 Machines
Unfortunately, VirtualBox doesn't work for Apple's M1 chip. To use the vm image on M1 machines, you will have to install [qemu](https://www.qemu.org/) and run the vm with it.

To install qemu:

```bash
brew install qemu
```

To run vm using qemu:

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -cpu qemu64 \
  -m 4096 \
  -device e1000,netdev=net0,mac=08:00:27:D3:23:52 \
  -netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 \
  -drive file=/Path/to/pa1box/pa1box-data.vmdk
```

User and ssh settings are the same as using VirtualBox.

# Part 1: Using GDB *(10 pts)*

Files for this sub-assignment are located in the `gdb` subdirectory of the `student` user's home
directory in the VM image; that is, `/home/student/gdb`. SSH into the VM and `cd` into that
directory to begin working on it.

Inside the `gdb` directory, you'll find `fib.c`, a C program demonstrating the Fibonacci sequence;
a `Makefile`; and `hw1.txt`, in which you'll record your responses to the questions below. The
first step is to compile `fib` by running `make` on the command line.

To run the `fib` executable in GDB, run `gdb fib`.
I recommend the following workflow in GDB:

1. **Starting.** Set breakpoints that you can later use for analysis:
    - `b f` &mdash; break at function `f`
    - `b *0x08048489` &mdash; break at the instruction at address 0x08048489
    - `r` &mdash; run the executable
2. **Analyzing.** Examine memory, registers, etc; disassemble code; show stack frames, backtrace,
   etc; and more:
    - `disas f` &mdash; disassemble function `f`
    - `i r` &mdash; view registers
    - `where` &mdash; view stack frames
    - `x <loc>` &mdash; examine memory
    - `x $eip` &mdash; examine current instruction pointer
    - `x /10x $esp` &mdash; examine 10 words at top of stack
    - `x /10x buf` &mdash; examine 10 words in `buf`
    - `x /10i $eip` &mdash; examine 10 instructions starting at instruction pointer
    - `x /10i f` &mdash; examine 10 instructions starting at `f`
3. **Continuing.** Continue analysis:
    - `c` &mdash; continue execution until next breakpoint/watchpoint
    - `si` &mdash; step to the next instruction
    - `s` &mdash; step to the next line of source code

Note that this is only a cursory overview of GDB; much more info is available from online
resources.

## Assignment Instructions

Complete the following exercises and **fill out [`hw1.txt`](../resources/hw1.txt)** with your answers. 
**Follow the directions in the template, do not delete the square brackets**

1. What is the value, in hex, of the `ecx` register when the function f is called for the first time? *(2 pts)*
2. Which register stores the value of the variable `i` in the function main (before f is called)? *(2 pts)*
3. What is the address, in hex, of the function `f`? *(2 pts)*
4. What is the name of the 6th instruction of the function `f`? *(2 pts)*
5. When `f` completes after being called from `main`, to which address in `main` does control
   return? Write your answer in hex form. *(2 pts)*

## Submission

Submit `hw1.txt` to "PA1: gdb" on Gradescope. Gradescope will check that it has successfully detected your answers, but it will not give you your grade until the due date.

# Part 2: `echo` in x86 *(10 pts)*

Files for this sub-assignment are located in the `x86` subdirectory of the `student` user's home
directory in the VM image; that is, `/home/student/x86`. SSH into the VM and `cd` into that
directory to begin working on it.

For this part, you will be implementing a simplified version of the familiar `echo` command, using
raw x86 assembly code. The goal of this assignment is to familiarize you with writing programs
directly in x86.

Your `echo` command must behave as follows:

- When run with a single command line argument (e.g., `./echo Hello`):
    1. Prints that argument back to the console's standard output (stdout).
    2. Prints a trailing newline (`\n`).
    3. Exits with code 0.
- When run with too few command line arguments (e.g., `./echo`) or too many (e.g., `./echo Hello
  World`):
    1. Prints *exactly* the error message `This command expects exactly one argument.` &mdash;
       followed by a trailing newline (`\n`) &mdash; to the console's standard *error* (stderr).
    2. Exits with code 1.

Your code should be written in the file `echo.s` inside the `x86` directory. A heavily-commented
example `echo.s` is provided, which simply prints the message `Hello World` (followed by a trailing
newline) to stdout. Your job is to modify this program to meet the specification for `echo` above.

A `Makefile` is included, so you can build the `echo` binary by running `make` from the command line.

## Helpful Hints

- In a Linux program, stdout is file descriptor number 1 and stderr is number 2.
- Linux programs start with `argc` at the top of the stack, accessible at `0(%esp)` from
  x86-assembly programs. Below it is `argv`, the array of pointers to *(null-terminated)* strings
  passed into the program as arguments. So `argv[0]` can be accessed from x86-assembly programs at
  `4(%esp)`, `argv[1]` at `8(%esp)`, `argv[2]` at `12(%esp)`, and so on.
- `argv[0]` is the name of the program executed, *not* the first argument, which is `argv[1]` if
  supplied (or `8(%esp)` for our purposes). Then `argc` (or `0(%esp)`) will be 1 if the program was
  not passed any arguments, 2 if it was passed 1 argument, and so on.
- This [table of Linux system calls](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/constants/syscalls.md#x86-32_bit) may come in handy.
