    **CSE 127: Intro to Computer Security**
         [*Deian Stefan*](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dstefan/)

About
==============================================================

This course focuses on computer security, covering a wide range of topics on
both the _defensive_ and _offensive_ side of this field. Among these will be
systems security and exploitation (e.g., buffer overflows and return-oriented
programming), sandboxing and isolation, covert channels, network security,
language-based security, cryptography, privacy and anonymity.  The goal of the
course is to provide an appreciation of how to think adversarially with respect
to computer systems as well as an appreciation of how to reason about attacks
and defenses. 

To complete the projects in this course, you will need to be able to write code
in C and (some) C++, and have some understanding of x86 assembly, JavaScript,
PHP and SQL. We will not teach these in lecture; you are expected to learn them
on your own or ask for help in section or office hours. If you don't know C,
K&R's [The C Programming
Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language) is a go to,
but the [Hacking](https://nostarch.com/hacking2.htm) book is probably enough
and covers x86 assembly and many of the topics in this class.

Thu Dec  9 2021: Final exam

Textbook
==============================================================

We will occasionally be assigning readings from Ross Anderson's [Security
Engineering](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html) and various other
online resources and research papers.  We may also assign optional reading from
Jon Erickson's [Hacking: The Art of
Exploitation](https://nostarch.com/hacking2.htm).

Evaluation and grading
==============================================================

Beyond lectures, we will reinforce concepts and explore new ones via
programming assignments, a final exam, and online discussions. Each of these
will be used towards your final grade, as further described below.

Programming assignments (55%)
-----------------------

We will have eight programming assignments. These assignments are meant to both
reinforce your knowledge of the concepts covered in lecture and get you to
think about security in more depth, beyond what is covered lecture.

You are expected to work on the assignments by yourself. You may discuss the
assignments with students from the course---in general---but not any specific
solution. There are no late days, but you will receive an additional 10% if you
turn in your assignment by the early date. Specifically, we'll compute each
assignment grade as:

```
early ?  min(100%, grade + grade*10%) : grade
```

If you consult anything (books, academic papers, internet resources, people)
when working on the assignments, note this in your submission.  We encourage
outside learning but expect you to not seek out specific details about a
solution---anything submitted should be considered your own work.  Similarly,
you are expected to not publish or otherwise share your solutions at any point
(even after the class is over).  If you are unsure about what is allowed,
please ask the course staff.

Exam (40%)
-----------------------

The midterm is
**closed-book**, but you may use a double-sided cheat sheet (letter-size).

The final is
**closed-book**, but you may use 2 double-sided cheat sheets (letter-size).

The exams will make up 40% of your grade. Since the final is cumulative your
midterm grade will be calculated as:

```
midterm > 0 ?  max(final, midterm) : 0
```

This means that (1) you basically get a second chance if you don't so well on
the midterm and (2) you must show up to both the midterm and the final.  If you
need to miss either exam because of an emergency, contact the instructor.


Participation (5%)
-----------------------

We will assign readings with most lectures. You are expected to have a vague
understanding of the concepts that will be discussed in class. This will allow
us to spend the lecture time to solidify your understanding. But we recommend
re-reading after class as well.

Asking and answering questions in lecture, on Piazza, or during office hours
counts towards your class participation. Starting discussions (e.g., around the
readings) online also counts is encouraged!

Scribe notes (&le; 10%)
-----------------------

We are working on scribe notes to make up for the lack of a textbook. Groups
from [Nadia Heninger](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~nadiah/)'s CSE 127 (Winter 2021)
put together the first set of lecture notes. You can earn up to 10% in extra
credit by contributing to this effort. Since this is extra credit (and you
would be editing existing text), we expect your contributions to be
substantial: This means the final text should clear, well-organized, and
complete.  Take a look at [scribe notes from David Wagner's class at
Berkeley](https://sp20.cs161.org/assets/notes/MemorySafety.1.24.pdf) for
motivation. If you are interested in this, form a group and contact the
instructor.

Academic integrity and student conduct
==============================================================

By taking this course, you implicitly agree to abide by the UCSD policies on
[Integrity of
Scholarship](https://senate.ucsd.edu/Operating-Procedures/Senate-Manual/appendices/2)
and [Student Conduct](https://students.ucsd.edu/sponsor/student-conduct/).  See
the [Academic Integrity Support for Remote
Learning](https://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu/take-action/covid-19-students.html).
University rules on integrity of scholarship and code of conduct are taken
seriously and will be enforced.
