This course focuses on computer security, covering a wide range of topics on
both the "defensive" and "offensive" side of this field. Among these will be
systems security and exploitation (buffer overflows, race conditions, SQL
injection, etc), access control and authentication, covert channels, network
security, language-based security, denial-of-service, privacy and anonymity.
The goal of the course is to provide an appreciation of how to think
adversarially with respect to computer systems as well as an appreciation of
how to reason about attacks and defenses. 

To complete the projects in this course, you will need the ability to develop
software programs using the C language, and some understanding of x86 assembly,
JavaScript, PHP and SQL. We will not reach these in class and you will be
expected to learn them on your own. If you don't know C, K&R's [The C
Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language)
is a great go to, but the [Hacking](https://nostarch.com/hacking2.htm) book is
probably enough and covers some x86 assembly too.

#### Textbook

We will occasionally be assinging readings from Ross Anderson's [Security
Engineering](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html) and various other
online resources and papers.  We may also assign optional reading from Jon
Erickson's [Hacking: The Art of
Exploitation](https://nostarch.com/hacking2.htm).

#### Instructors

#### TAs
- Sunjay Cauligi
- Craig Disselkoen
- John Renner

#### Grading

- 30% Homeworks assignments
- 30% Midterm exam
- 40% Final exam
- +5% Participation in class and online

##### Homework and programming labs

We will have homework assignments that are meant to both reinforce your
knowledge of the concepts covered in lecture and get you to think about
security in more depth, beyond what is covered lecture.

You are expected to work on the assignments by yourself. You may discuss
the assignments with students from the course, in general, but not any specific
solution. There are no late days, but you will receive an additional 10% if you
turn in your assignment by the early date.

If you consult anything (books, academic papers, internet resources, people not
in your group) when working on the assignments, note this in your submission.
We encourage outside learning but expect you to not seek out specific details
about a solution -- anything submitted should be considered your own work.
Similarly, you are expected to not publish or otherwise share your solutions at
any point (even after the class is over).  If you are unsure about what is
allowed, please ask the course staff.

##### Exams

The midterm is
**closed-book**, but you may use a double-sided cheat sheet (letter-size).

The final is
**closed-book**, but you may use 2 double-sided cheat sheets (letter-size).

The exams will make up 70% of your grade. Since the final is cumulative your
midterm grade will be calculated as:

```
midterm > 0 ?  max(final, midterm) : 0
```

This means that (1) you basically get a second chance if you don't so well on
the midterm and (2) you must show up to both the midterm and the final.  If you
need to miss either exam because of a documented medical emergency, contact the
instructor immediately.

##### Participation/pre-lecture readings

Before each class there will be some assigned reading. You are expected to do
the reading and have at least a vague understanding of the concepts that will
be discussed in class. This will allow us to spend the lecture time to solidify
your understanding.  Asking and answering questions in class, on Piazza, or
during office hours counts towards your class participation.
