            <p>This is a group project; you can work in a team of size at most two and submit one
              project per team. You are not required to work with the same partner on every project.
              You and your partner should collaborate closely on each part.</p>

            <p>You have two/three? late days that you may use to turn in work past the
              deadline over the entire quarter. A late day is a contiguous 24-hour
              period. Both you and your partner will be charged for every late day
              that you use, and you both must have late days to use them. These
              late days are intended to cover your extension needs for usual
              circumstances: brief illness, busy with other classes, interviews,
              travel, extracurricular conflicts, and so on. You do not need to ask
              permission to use a late day.</p>

            <p>The code and other answers you submit must be entirely your team's
              own work. You may discuss the conceptualization of the project and the
              meaning of the questions, but you may not look at any part of someone
              elseâ€™s solution or collaborate with anyone other than your
              partner. You may consult published references, provided that you
              appropriately cite them (e.g., with program comments).</p>

            <p>Solutions must be submitted to Gradescope.</p>

            <h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
            <p>The goal of this assignment is to become familiar with the setup that will be used for future
              assignments, such as the use of a virtual machine and the included turn-in script, as well as the
              basics of working with gdb and writing programs in x86 assembly.</p>
          </div>

          <h2>
            Getting Started
          </h2>

          <p>To complete this assignment, you are provided with a VirtualBox VM
            pre-populated with the assignment files.</p>

          <h3>
            VM Image
          </h3>
          <p>
            In order to match the environment in which your submission will be graded, all work for this
            assignment must be done on the VirtualBox VM we provide, named <code>pa0box</code>. You can download the VM
            image <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RdZO58lNrXmgpg85ZrKD2e3hDEHuo6NX/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The VM is configured with two users: <code>student</code>, with password <code>hacktheplanet</code>; and <code>root</code>, with
            password <code>hackallthethings</code>. The VM is configured with SSH on port 2222. Please note that SSH is
            disabled for <code>root</code>, so you can only SSH in as the <code>student</code> user. You can still log in as <code>root</code>
            using <code>su</code> or by logging into the VM directly.
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>
              # To SSH into the VM:<br/>

              ssh -p 2222 student@127.0.0.1<br/><br/>

              # To copy files from your computer to the VM: <br/>

              scp -P 2222 -r /path/to/files/ student@127.0.0.1:/home/student<br/><br/>

              # To copy files from the VM to your computer:<br/>

              scp -P 2222 student@127.0.0.1:/path/to/files/ /destination/path<br/>

        <h2>Part 1: Using GDB</h2>
        <p>
          Alice is a security engineer in a company called Security4All. She felt 
          that their programs are running a bit weird recently. After doing some
          research, she suspect that the C compiler they are using might have
          been backdoored. It is a huge issue because a compromised compiler
          will potentially defeat all security mechanism they implemented in a
          higher level language. Now Alice heard that you have experience with
          gdb in some classes and asks for your help to learn the behavior of a
          program using gdb.
        </p>

        <p>
          Files for this sub-assignment are located in the <code>gdb</code> subdirectory of the <code>student</code> user's home
          directory in the VM image; that is, <code>/home/student/gdb</code>. SSH into the VM and <code>cd</code> into that
          directory to begin working on it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Inside the <code>gdb</code> directory, you'll find <code>fib.c</code>, a C program demonstrating the Fibonacci sequence;
          a <code>Makefile</code>; and <code>hw1.txt</code>, in which you'll record your responses to the questions below. The
          first step is to compile <code>fib</code> by running <code>make</code> on the command line.
        </p>

        <p>
          To run the <code>fib</code> executable in GDB, run <code>gdb fib</code>.
          I recommend the following workflow in GDB:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Starting.</strong> Set breakpoints that you can later use for analysis:
            <ul>
              <li><code>b f</code> &mdash; break at function <code>f</code></li>
              <li><code>b *0x08048489</code> &mdash; break at the instruction at address 0x08048489</li>
              <li><code>r</code> &mdash; run the executable</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Analyzing.</strong> Examine memory, registers, etc; disassemble code; show stack frames, backtrace, etc; and more:
            <ul>
              <li><code>disas f</code> &mdash; disassemble function <code>f</code></li>
              <li><code>i r</code> &mdash; view registers</li>
              <li><code>where</code> &mdash; view stack frames</li>
              <li><code>x <loc></code> &mdash; examine memory</li>
              <li><code>x $eip</code> &mdash; examine current instruction pointer</li>
              <li><code>x /10x $esp</code> &mdash; examine 10 words at top of stack</li>
              <li><code>x /10x buf</code> &mdash; examine 10 words in <code>buf</code></li>
              <li><code>x /10i $eip</code> &mdash; examine 10 instructions starting at instruction pointer</li>
              <li><code>x /10i f</code> &mdash; examine 10 instructions starting at <code>f</code></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Continuing.</strong> Continue analysis:
            <ul>
              <li><code>c</code> &mdash; continue execution until next breakpoint/watchpoint</li>
              <li><code>si</code> &mdash; step to the next instruction</li>
              <li><code>s</code> &mdash; step to the next line of source code</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Note that this is only a cursory overview of GDB; much more info is available from online
          resources.
        </p>

        <h2>Help</h2>
        <h3>Hints</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>In a Linux program, stdout is file descriptor number 1 and stderr is number 2.</li>
          <li>Linux programs start with <code>argc</code> at the top of the stack, accessible at <code>0(%esp)</code> from</li>
            x86-assembly programs. Below it is <code>argv</code>, the array of pointers to <i>(null-terminated)</i> strings
            passed into the program as arguments. So <code>argv[0]</code> can be accessed from x86-assembly programs at
            <code>4(%esp)</code>, <code>argv[1]</code> at <code>8(%esp)</code>, <code>argv[2]</code> at <code>12(%esp)</code>, and so on.
          <li><code>argv[0]</code> is the name of the program executed, <i>not</i> the first argument, which is <code>argv[1]</code> if</li>
            supplied (or <code>8(%esp)</code> for our purposes). Then <code>argc</code> (or <code>0(%esp)</code>) will be 1 if the program was
            not passed any arguments, 2 if it was passed 1 argument, and so on.
          <li>This <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/constants/syscalls.md#x86-32_bit">table of Linux system calls</a> may come in handy.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>M1 machines</h3>
        <p>
        VirtualBox doesn't work on M1 machines. To use the vm image on M1 machines, you will have to install <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">qemu</a> and run the vm with it.
        </p>        

        <code>
        brew install qemu<br/><br/>
        qemu-system-x86_64 \<br/>
          -cpu qemu64 \<br/>
          -m 4096 \<br/>
          -device e1000,netdev=net0,mac=08:00:27:D3:23:52 \<br/>
          -netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 \<br/>
          -drive file=/Path/to/pa0box/pa0box-data.vmdk
        </code>
        
        <p>
        User and ssh settings are the same as using VirtualBox.
