**Early Turn-In: Monday, December 7, 2020 by 11:59:59 PM (10% bonus)**

**Hard Deadline: Wednesday, December 9, 2020 by 11:59:59 PM Pacific Time**

## Overview

In this project, we'll start by investigating Vigenere ciphers, then
move on to investigating vulnerabilities in widely used
cryptographic hash functions, including length-extension attacks and collision
vulnerabilities, and an implementation vulnerability in a popular digital
signature scheme.

## Part 1: Vigenere ciphers

For this problem, solve by hand or write a program (perhaps in Python).

You can read about how the Vigenere cipher works [on
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher#Description). 
Vigenere ciphers can be generally deciphered using Kasiski Examination, which is
discussed on the wikipedia page.

You can find some ciphertext produced with the Vigenere cipher under a certain
key on Gradescope as the assignment "PA 7: ciphertext".

We also provided sample code for decrypting ciphertext [sample decryption code here](../resources/decrypt.py).

Assume that encrypting the letter `A` with the key results in no change, encrypting
the letter `B` results in an increment by one place in the alphabet, encrypting `C`
resulting in an increment by two places, etc.
Also assume that the original plaintext contains only uppercase letters (A-Z)
and no spaces or punctuation.

What is the key?

**What to submit** A text file named `vigenere.key` containing your key. 

_Historical note_: This November, it was discovered that the security company
Fortinet was using "XOR encryption with a static key" in some products, which
is similar to a Vigenere cipher and has similar (lack of) security properties.

## Part 2: Length extension

In most applications, you should use MACs such as HMAC-SHA256 instead of plain
cryptographic hash functions (e.g., MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256) because hashes, also
known as digests, fail to match our intuitive security expectations.  What we
really want is something that behaves like a pseudorandom function, which HMACs
seem to approximate and hash functions do not.

One difference between hash functions and pseudorandom functions is that many
hashes are subject to _length extension_.  Many common hash functions use a
design called the Merkle-Damgard construction.  Each is built around a
_compression function_ _f_ and maintains an internal state _s_, which is
initialized to a fixed constant.  Messages are processed in fixed-size blocks
by applying the compression function to the current state and current block to
compute an updated internal state, i.e., s\_{i+1} = f(s\_i, b\_i).  The result
of the final application of the compression function becomes the output of the
hash function.

A consequence of this design is that if we know the hash of an _n_-block
message, we can find the hash of longer messages by applying the compression
function for each block b\_{n+1}, b\_{n+2}, ... that we want to add.  This
process is called length extension, and it can be used to attack many
applications of hash functions.

### 2a. Experimenting

To experiment with this idea, we'll use a Python implementation of the MD5 hash
function, though SHA-1 and SHA-256 are vulnerable to length extension in the
same way.  You can [download the `pymd5` module here](../resources/pymd5.py) and
learn how to use it by running `pydoc pymd5`.  To follow
along with these examples, run Python in interactive mode and run the command
`from pymd5 import md5, padding`.

Consider the string "Use HMAC, not hashes".  We can compute its MD5 hash by
running:

```python
from pymd5 import md5, padding
m = "Use HMAC, not hashes"
h = md5()
h.update(m)
print(h.hexdigest())
```

or, more compactly,

```python
print(md5(m).hexdigest())
```

The output should be `3ecc68efa1871751ea9b0b1a5b25004d`.

MD5 processes messages in 512-bit blocks, so internally, the hash function
pads _m_ to a multiple of that length.  The padding consists of the bit 1,
followed by as many 0 bits as necessary, followed by a 64-bit count of the
number of bits in the unpadded message.  (If the 1 and the count won't fit in
the current block, an additional block is added.)  You can use the function
`padding(count)` in the `pymd5` module to compute the padding that will be
added to a _count_-bit message.

Even if we didn't know _m_, we could compute the hash of longer messages of the
general form `m + padding(len(m)*8) + suffix` by setting the initial internal
state of our MD5 function to `MD5(m)`, instead of the default initialization
value, and setting the function's message length counter to the size of _m_
plus the padding (a multiple of the block size).  To find the padded message
length, guess the length of _m_ and run `bits = (length_of_m +
len(padding(length_of_m * 8))) * 8`.

The `pymd5` module lets you specify these parameters as additional arguments
to the `md5` object:

```python
h = md5(state=codecs.decode("3ecc68efa1871751ea9b0b1a5b25004d", "hex"), count=512)
```

Now you can use length extension to find the hash of a longer string that
appends the suffix "Good advice".  Simply run:

```python
x = "Good advice"
h.update(x)
print(h.hexdigest())
```

to execute the compression function over _x_ and output the resulting hash.
Verify that it equals the MD5 hash of `m + padding(len(m)*8) + x`.  Notice
that, due to the length-extension property of MD5, we didn't need to know
the value of `m` to compute the hash of the longer string - all we needed to
know was `m`'s length and its MD5 hash.

This part of the assignment is intended to introduce length extension and
familiarize you with the Python MD5 module we will be using; you will not
need to submit anything for it.

### 2b. Conduct a length extension attack

Length extension attacks can cause serious vulnerabilities when people
mistakenly try to construct something like an HMAC by using _hash(secret
|| message)_. The National Bank of CSE 127, which is not up-to-date on
its security practices, hosts an API that allows its client-side applications
to perform actions on behalf of a user by loading URLs of the form:

`http://bank.cse127.ucsd.edu/pa7/api?token=d6613c382dbb78b5592091e08f6f41fe&user=nadiah&command1=ListSquirrels&command2=NoOp`

where `token` is MD5(_user's 8-character password_ || `user=...` _[the rest of
the decoded URL starting from user= and ending with the last command]_).

Using the techniques that you learned in the previous section and without
guessing the password, apply length extension to create a URL ending with
`&command3=UnlockAllSafes` that would be treated as valid by the server API.

_Note_: Because of its bad security practices, the National Bank of CSE 127 has 
taken down its website. So you'll have to use gradescope to test if your attack
URL would work.

_Hint_: You might want to use the `quote()` function from Python's `urllib.parse`
module to encode non-ASCII characters in the URL.

_Historical fact_: In 2009, security researchers found that the API used by
the photo-sharing site Flickr suffered from a length-extension vulnerability
almost exactly like the one in this exercise.

**What to submit** A Python 3.x script named `len_ext_attack.py` that:

1. Accepts a valid URL in the same form as the one above as a command line argument.
2. Modifies the URL so that it will execute the `UnlockAllSafes` command as the user.
3. Prints the new URL to the command line.

You should make the following assumptions:

- The input URL will have the same form as the sample above, but we may change the
server hostname and the values of `token`, `user`, `command1`, and `command2`.
These values may be of substantially different lengths than in the sample.

- The input URL may be for a user with a different password, but the length of the
password will be unchanged.

You can base your code on the following example:

```python
import sys, urllib.parse
from pymd5 import md5, padding
url = sys.argv[1]

# Your code to modify url goes here

print(new_url)
```

## Part 3: MD5 collisions

MD5 was once the most widely used cryptographic hash function, but today it is
considered dangerously insecure.  This is because cryptanalysts have discovered
efficient algorithms for finding _collisions_---pairs of messages with the
same MD5 hash value.

The first known collisions were announced on August 17, 2004 by Xiaoyun Wang,
Dengguo Feng, Xuejia Lai, and Hongbo Yu. Here's one pair of colliding messages
they published:

Message 1:

```
d131dd02c5e6eec4693d9a0698aff95c 2fcab58712467eab4004583eb8fb7f89
55ad340609f4b30283e488832571415a 085125e8f7cdc99fd91dbdf280373c5b
d8823e3156348f5bae6dacd436c919c6 dd53e2b487da03fd02396306d248cda0
e99f33420f577ee8ce54b67080a80d1e c69821bcb6a8839396f9652b6ff72a70
```

Message 2:

```
d131dd02c5e6eec4693d9a0698aff95c 2fcab50712467eab4004583eb8fb7f89
55ad340609f4b30283e4888325f1415a 085125e8f7cdc99fd91dbd7280373c5b
d8823e3156348f5bae6dacd436c919c6 dd53e23487da03fd02396306d248cda0
e99f33420f577ee8ce54b67080280d1e c69821bcb6a8839396f965ab6ff72a70
```

Copy the above hex strings into file1.hex and file2.hex. 
Convert each group of hex strings into a binary file.
(On Linux, run `xxd -r -p file.hex > file`.)

1. What are the MD5 hashes of the two binary files? Verify that they're the same.
(`openssl dgst -md5 file1 file2`)
2. What are their SHA-256 hashes? Verify that they're different.
(`openssl dgst -sha256 file1 file2`)

You don't need to submit anything for the above questions.

### 3a. Generating collisions yourself

In 2004, Wang's method took more than 5 hours to find a collision on a desktop
PC.  Since then, researchers have introduced vastly more efficient collision
finding algorithms.  You can compute your own MD5 collisions using a tool
written by Marc Stevens that uses a more advanced technique.

You can download the `fastcoll` tool here:

[http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/fastcoll_v1.0.0.5.exe.zip](http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/fastcoll_v1.0.0.5.exe.zip)
(Windows executable)

or

[http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/fastcoll_v1.0.0.5-1_source.zip](http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/fastcoll_v1.0.0.5-1_source.zip)
(source code)

If you are compiling `fastcoll` from source, you can compile
using this [makefile](../../resources/fastcoll_Makefile).  You will also need to
have installed the Boost libraries.  On Ubuntu, you can install using `apt-get
install libboost-all-dev`.  On OS X, you can install Boost via the [Homebrew
package manager](http://brew.sh) using `brew install boost`.

1. Generate your own collision with this tool.  How long did it take?
(`time ./fastcoll -o file1 file2`)

2. What are your files? To get a hex dump, run `xxd -p file`.

3. What are their MD5 hashes? Verify that they're the same.

4. What are their SHA-256 hashes? Verify that they're different.

**What to submit** Write your answers in `writeup.txt`. This file will also be 
used for part 5. 

### 3b. A hash collision attack

The collision attack lets us generate two messages with the same MD5 hash and
any chosen (identical) prefix.  Due to MD5's length-extension behavior, we can
append any suffix to both messages and know that the longer messages will also
collide.  This lets us construct files that differ only in a binary "blob" in
the middle and have the same MD5 hash, i.e. _prefix_ || _blobA_ || _suffix_
and _prefix_ || _blobB_ || _suffix_.

We can leverage this to create two programs (shell scripts) that have identical
MD5 hashes but wildly different behaviors.  We're using shell scripts, but this
could be done using a program in almost any language.  Put the following two
lines into a file called `prefix`:

```
#!/bin/bash
cat << "EOF" | openssl dgst -sha256 > DIGEST
```

and put these four lines (starting with a blank line) into a file called `suffix`:

```

EOF
digest=$(cat DIGEST | sed 's/(stdin)= //' )
echo "The sha256 digest is $digest"
```

Now use `fastcoll` to generate two files with the same MD5 hash that both begin
with `prefix`. (`fastcoll -p prefix -o col1 col2`.)  Then append the suffix to both
(`cat col1 suffix > file1.sh; cat col2 suffix > file2.sh`).  Verify that `file1.sh`
and `file2.sh` have the same MD5 hash but generate different output.

Extend this technique to produce another pair of programs, `good` and `evil`, that
also share the same MD5 hash.  One program should execute a benign payload: echo
or print `"I mean no harm."` The second should execute a pretend malicious payload:
echo or print `"You are doomed!"`

**What to submit** Two scripts, `good` and `evil`, that have the same MD5 hash, have
different SHA-256 hashes, and print the specified messages.

## Part 4: RSA signature forgery

A secure implementation of RSA encryption or digital signatures requires a
proper padding scheme.  RSA without padding, also known as _textbook RSA_,
has several undesirable properties. For example, it is trivial for an attacker
with only an RSA public key pair _(n,e)_ to produce a mathematically valid
message, signature pair by choosing an _s_ and returning _(s^e, s)_.

In order to prevent an attacker from being able to forge valid signatures in
this way, RSA implementations use a padding scheme to provide structure to the
messages that are encrypted or signed.  The most commonly used padding scheme
in practice is defined by the PKCS #1 v1.5 standard, which can be found at
[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2313](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2313).
The standard defines, among other things, the format of RSA keys and signatures
and the procedures for generating and validating RSA signatures.

### 4a. Validating RSA signatures

You can experiment with validating RSA signatures yourself.  Create a file called
`key.pub` that contains the following RSA public key:

```
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MFowDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEBBQADSQAwRgJBALB8X0rLPrfgAfXMW73LjKYb5V9QG5LU
DrmsA9CAittsLvh2c082wHwVyCIiWQ8S3AA/jfW839sFN4zAZkW2S3cCAQM=
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

You can view the modulus and public exponent of this key by running:

```
openssl rsa -in key.pub -pubin -text -noout
```

Create a file containing only the text `CSE 127 rul3z!`.

```
echo -n 'CSE 127 rul3z!' > message
```

The following is a base64-encoded signature of the file `message` using the public
key above.

```
RaHHC2E0qm1sauuhlV3KBGiaTb5IGmaaNFQn22ykTSu88EIBkBG48gjiamc3l+4HJYUwpZDefcT2
dLPyaOHA/w==
```

Convert this signature into a binary file:

```
base64 -d -i sig.b64 > sig
```

Now verify the signature against the file you created.

```
openssl dgst -sha1 -verify key.pub -signature sig message
```

We can also use basic math operations in Python to explore this signature further.
Remember, RSA ciphertexts, plaintexts, exponents, moduli, and signatures are actually
all integers.

Open a Python shell and run the following commands to import the signature as an integer:

```python
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Hash import SHA
signature = int(open('sig', 'rb').read().hex(), 16)
```

Next, import the public key file that you created earlier:

```python
pubkey = RSA.importKey(open('key.pub').read())
```

The modulus and exponent are then accessible as `pubkey.n` and `pubkey.e`, respectively.
Now reverse the signing operation and examine the resulting value in hex:

```python
"{:0128x}".format(pow(signature, pubkey.e, pubkey.n))
```

You should see something like `'0001fffff ... 22c1422dac3c4e5fdd87040b3fb156acd3d83d1f'`
Verify that the last 20 bytes of this value match the SHA-1 hash of your file:

```python
SHA.new(b"CSE 127 rul3z!").hexdigest()
```

You don't need to submit anything for this part.

### 4b. PKCS #1 v1.5 signature padding

The signed value you examined in the previous section had been padded using the
PKCS \#1 v1.5 signature scheme.  PKCS \#1 v1.5 padding for RSA signatures is
structured as follows: one `00` byte, one `01` byte, some
`FF` bytes, another `00` byte, some special ASN.1 bytes denoting
which hash algorithm was used to compute the hash digest, then the bytes of the
hash digest itself. The number of `FF` bytes varies such that the size
of _m_ is equal to the size of the RSA key.

A _k_-bit RSA key used to sign a SHA-1 hash digest will generate the following
padded value of _m_:

```
  00 01 FF...FF 00 3021300906052B0E03021A05000414 XX...XX
        ^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^
    k/8 - 38 bytes wide         ||            20-byte SHA-1 digest
                        ASN.1 "magic" bytes
```

When PKCS padding is used, it is important for implementations to verify that
every bit of the padded, signed message is exactly as it should be.  It is
tempting for an implementer to validate the signature by first stripping off
the `00 01` bytes, then some number of padding `FF` bytes, then
`00`, and then parse the ASN.1 and verify the hash.  If the
implementation does not check the length of the `FF` bytes and that the
hash is in the least significant bits of the message, then it is possible for
an attacker to forge values that pass this validation check.

This possibility is particularly troubling for signatures generated with _e =
3_. If the length of the required padding, ASN.1 bytes, and hash value is
significantly less than _n^{1/3}_ then an attacker can construct a cube root
over the integers whose most significant bits will validate as a correct
signature, ignoring the actual key.  To construct a "signature" that will
validate against such implementations, an attacker simply needs to construct an
integer whose most significant bytes have the correct format, including the
hashed message, pad the remainder of this value with zeros or other garbage
that will be ignored by the vulnerable implementation, and then take a cube
root over the integers, rounding as appropriate.

### 4c. Constructing forged signatures

The National Bank of CSE 127 has a website that its employees
use to initiate wire transfers between bank accounts. To authenticate each
transfer request, the control panel requires a signature from a particular
2048-bit RSA key:

```
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIIBIDANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ0AMIIBCAKCAQEArBOrcgTp5r77Uz5CV1HX
9w19lmmkMqlh81paBr4SvrkTqXTmevSlRQE5pSJ7Y3rz7I4HbdVpYq16nlaF9TIj
ig5i1SzNMe4Uo+Plv/O5kYYZOM3Do69E8dujOqgoxwPxaAqRwA411k5egJd8VhJ+
n6zilsTZ5QroSP/LEzKDku3OnXZKxzDKmdzs/nS4aHBK89b5IqwHOQFSbQA0tlkJ
1BmFvGKc3WUfVk0KgdeS/b3zMX8OdKJxtJWYAo7BfJlxFU81/Gl1XEqr8dWUqZ7J
8WaQ2fiBmoHSIOd5sQ9K6g3+tfeHfnvV8vkrqV1J9jAp6yirGCbyuy+jrUac5CJg
zwIBAw==
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

Unfortunately, this
control panel is running old software that has not been patched to fix the
signature forgery vulnerability.

Using the signature forgery technique described above, produce an RSA signature
that validates against the National Bank of CSE 127 site.

_Historical fact:_ This attack was discovered by Daniel Bleichenbacher, who
presented it in a lightning talk at the rump session at the Crypto 2006
conference.  His talk is described in this mailing list posting:
[https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/openpgp/current/msg00999.html](https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/openpgp/current/msg00999.html).
At the time, many important implementations of RSA signatures were discovered
to be vulnerable to this attack, including OpenSSL.  In 2014, the Mozilla
library NSS was found to be vulnerable to this type of attack:
[https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2014-73/](https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2014-73).

**What to submit** A Python 3.x script called `bleichenbacher.py` that:

1. Accepts a double-quoted string as command-line argument.
2. Prints a base64-encoded forged signature of the input string.

We have provided a Python library, `roots.py`, that
provides several useful functions that you may wish to use when implementing
your solution.  You can [download the library here](../resources/roots.py). Your program
may assume that PyCrypto and `roots.py` are available, and may use standard
Python libraries, but should otherwise be self-contained.

In order to use these functions, you will have to import `roots.py`. You
may wish to use the following template:

```python
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Hash import SHA
from roots import *
import sys

message = sys.argv[1]

# Your code to forge a signature goes here.

# some example functions from roots
root, is_exact = integer_nthroot(27, 3)
print(integer_to_base64(root))
```

## 5. Writeup

1. With reference to the construction of HMAC, explain how changing the design
of the API in 2b to use `token=HMAC(_user's password_)(user=...)` would avoid
the length extension vulnerability.

2. Briefly explain why the technique you explored in 3b poses a danger
to systems that rely on digital signatures to verify the integrity of programs
before they are installed or executed.  Examples include Microsoft Authenticode
and most Linux package managers.  (Assume that these systems sign MD5 hashes of
the programs.)

3. Since 2010, NIST has specified that RSA public exponents must be at least
2^16 + 1.  Briefly explain why Bleichenbacher's attack would not work for these
keys.
