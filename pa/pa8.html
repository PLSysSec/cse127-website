# Introduction

## Setup

Download the [VM image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17mX_31nHvnHLANVIuLIturzri5A-XOs6/view?usp=sharing) containing the Crypto-DSL
library as well as starter code for this PA. As before, the username and
password are `student` and `hacktheplanet` and you can SSH into the VM using
port 2222.

All of the files you will need for this assignment can be found in the folder `tls-assignment/`.

## Introduction

In this assignment, you'll implement the client side of four short message
exchanges in a domain specific language for writing cryptographic protocols.
There are two unique features of this language that you will need to use in
this assignment: *parties* and *cryptographic primitives*.

### Parties

Protocols in this language are defined in terms of *parties* which can send and
receive messages. Parties look like functions, but begin with the keyword
`party`. Parties defined in the same file can communicate by
calling `<other_party>.send(value);` and `value = other_party.receive();`.
Calls to `send` and `receive` always block until the operation is completed.
For instance, the previous call to `receive` will block until `<other_party>`
sends a message. Likewise, the call to `send` will
not return until `<other_party>` is executing and receives the message.

### Cryptographic primitives

Several cryptographic primitives are built in to the language.
Typically, they are defined at the top of the file with the keyword `global`,
so that they are in scope for all functions and parties defined in the same file. For
example, the starter code makes use of an `AuthenticatedCipher` object which
has the following interface:

```
# instantiate a new AuthenticatedCipher
C = AuthenticatedCipher();

# encrypts plaintext using key
ct = C.encrypt(key, plaintext);

# decrypts ciphertext using key (decrypted is equivalent to plaintext)
decrypted = C.decrypt(key, ct);
```

The `key` and `plaintext` can be any value that can be serialized, which means we can
pass pretty much anything as these two arguments: You can encrypt an
`Integer`, a `String`, a `Tuple`, or even an `AuthenticatedCipher`. This also
means that the order of arguments is important, as it is easy to accidentally
encrypt the key with the message instead of the other way around (i.e., `ct =
C.encrypt(msg, key);` is incorrect but may not raise an error).

We have included an appendix at the end of this page that documents some of
the other cryptographic primitives that appear in the starter code, as well as
how to write useful language structures (like `if` statments). The starter code in
`prot.cy` also contains example usage of everything you will need to finish the
assignment.

## Starter code and scripts

Within the `tls-assignment/` folder you will find the starter code (`prot.cy`),
some library files (`schnorr.cy`, `ca_utils.cy`, `kdf.cy`), the executables
to run the code (`cdsl` and `coordinator`), and some helper bash scripts.

You will be finishing the implementation that is partially written in `prot.cy`.

The `coordinator` manages the communication between all parties in the protocol, and
needs to be running for messages to be sent. You can (re)start the coordinator
at any time by running `./restart_coordinator.sh`. If at any time your client or server
code hangs or otherwise is not connecting, simply re-run this script.

The `./client.sh` and `./server.sh` scripts run the client and server respectively.
They take two arguments: The protocol number (0-3) and a message to send to the other party.

# Your tasks

## Protocol 0: Unencrypted Messages (20 points)

We have given you the code for `server0`, which expects an unencrypted message
from the client and returns a response. Implement the corresponding `client0`
code so that it prints out the message it receives from the server.

If you implemented it correctly, then you should be able to send messages between the two parties:
1. Ensure that the coordinator is running: `./restart_coordinator.sh`
2. In one terminal, run the client: `./client.sh 0 "A message from client to server"`
3. In another terminal, run the server: `./server.sh 0 "A response from server to client"`
If all goes well, you should see each party's message print from the other party's output.

## Protocol 1: Basic Asymmetric Encryption (20 points)

Protocol 0 is obviously insecure: We're sending messages in the clear, and
anyone can snoop on the traffic and see our messages. To fix this, we
will use a Diffie-Hellman key exchange to derive a shared key that we will
use to symmetrically encrypt messages between the client and server.

Implement the party `client1`. The client should initiate a Diffie-Hellman key
exchange with the server and print out the decrypted message it receives.
You can use the implementation of `server1` as a hint for what you need to do.

If you implemented it correctly, then you should be able to send encrypted messages between the two parties:
1. Restart the coordinator if necessary: `./restart_coordinator.sh`
2. In one terminal, run the client: `./client.sh 1 "An encrypted client message"`
3. In another terminal, run the server: `./server.sh 1 "An encrypted server response"`
Be sure to specify protocol number **1** when starting the client and server.
As before, you should see each party's message print from the other party's output.

## Protocol 2: Signature Authentication (20 points)

Protocol 1 is better, but it's still susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.
In this new version, the server will sign its initial handshake so the client
is more certain who it's talking to.

Implement `client2`. The new client must verify the signature sent by the
server and print out either `"Handshake authenticated!"` or `"Failed to
authenticate!"` depending on the result of the signature verification. As
before, the client should also print out the decrypted message it receives.

You can test your client implementation by specifying protocol number **2** for
the client and server scripts.

## Protocol 3: Verifying with a CA (20 points)

Protocol 2 is more secure than Protocol 1, but the client still blindly
trusts the server's public key. A man-in-the-middle can still impersonate the
server. For Protocol 3, we introduce a certificate authority (CA) that will
help the client trust the identity of the server.

We have provided a party `ca_auth` that acts as a rudimentary CA. The server
will generate a certificate by sending its public key to the CA, which the CA
will then sign.

For this part, you will need to do the following:
 1. Finish implementing the party `server_setup`. This is the code for
   requesting a new certificate from a CA. The `server_setup` party already
   includes code to write its public certificate and corresponding secret key to
   a file for `server3` to use.
 2. Run `./server_setup.sh` to generate a certificate for the server. This
   helper script simply runs the `ca_auth` and `server_setup` parties, which will
   write the CA's public key, the server's private key, and the server's public
   certificate to files. If you implemented step 1 correctly, this script only
   needs to be run once.
 3. Implement the party `client3`. This client should verify that the server's
   certificate was indeed signed by the CA **before** it verifies the handshake
   signature.
    The client should print out either `"Certificate issued by CA."` or `"CA did not
    issue this certificate!"` after verifying the server certificate.

Note that this version of the protocol has both the server and client use an
additional _random nonce_ in the handshake to prevent replay attacks.

You can test your client implementation by specifying protocol number **3** for the
client and server scripts.

Congratulations! You have implemented a basic secure messaging protocol.

## Builtin Functions and Crypto Primitives

### IntMod and Random

```
random_int_mod10 = Random(IntMod(10));
```

`IntMod(n)` takes in an integer and returns the set of integers mod `n`.
`Random(set)` takes in a set of values and returns a random item in the set.
The snippet above uses both functions together to generate a random integer mod
10.

### MultiplicativeCyclicGroup

```
G = MultiplicativeCyclicGroup();
q = G.order;
g = G.generator;
```

A `MultiplicativeCyclicGroup` has two fields, `order`, an integer equal to the
number of elements in the group, and `generator`, a element of the group.  (See
the [Wikipedia
entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_group_of_integers_modulo_n)
if you are curious.) `MultiplicativeCyclicGroup` also overloads two operators,
`*` and `**`.  Specifically, `*` is overloaded for two group elements, and `**`
is overloaded for a group element, and an integer mod the group order. For
example, the following are valid expressions:

```
g_squared = g * g;
ga = g ** Random(IntMod(q));
```

The first line computes the product of the generator with itself, and the second
computes the generator raised to a random integer mod `q`, the group order.

## Syntax Reference

### Assignment

```
<name> = <expression>;
valid = validate(..)
```

Assigns the expression on the right hand side to the variable on the left hand side, creating a new variable if valid is undefined, or updating valid if it has already been defined.

### If Statement

```
if <expression> {
    <true_branch>
} else {
    <false_branch>
}

if not valid {
    print(“invalid”);
} else {
    print(“valid”);
}
```

Evaluates the expression after `if` and executes the first branch if it is `true`, and the second (optional) branch if it is `false`.

### Sending/Receiving

```
party alice() {
    bob.send(“hi”);
}

party bob() {
    print(alice.receive());
}
```

Parties are able to communicate by calling `<party_name>.send(..)` and `.. = <party_name>.receive()`, where `<party_name>` is the name of another party defined in the same file. `send` and `receive` are blocking operations, meaning that a protocol may deadlock, for instance if alice and bob both try to send first, instead of alice sending first, and bob receiving first.

### Calling an External Function

```
prot foo;
foo::bar();
```

Protocols can be separated into files and imported with the `prot` keyword. Then you can call functions in an external protocol with the syntax `<prot_name>::<fn_name>(..);`

### Tuple Destructuring

```
party alice() {
    ...
    sig = schnorr::sign(sk, (x, y, z));
    bob.send((sig, x, y, z));
}

party bob() {
    ...
    (sig, x, y, z) = alice.receive();
    valid = schnorr::verify(pk, (x, y, z));
}
```

Multiple values can be grouped into a tuple, which is useful if you want to send a message that has multiple values, or generate a signature over those values. In the snippet above, alice uses `(x, y, z)` to group three variables together into a tuple to be signed, and then sends `(sig, x, y, z)` to bob. Bob destructures the tuple with `(sig, x, y, z) = alice.receive();` so that each item in the tuple can be used later in the protocol.

### Defining a Function

```
def <fn_name>(<arg1>, <arg2>, ...) {
    <fn_body>
}

def validate(material) {
    return material == 123;
}
```

Defines a function with named arguments that can return a value. Variables defined as `global` in the same file are in scope in `<fn_body>`, as well as any other functions or structs defined in that file.

### Defining a Party

```
party <party_name>(<arg1>, <arg2>, ...) {
    <party_body>
}

party alice() {
    bob.send(“hello”);
}
```

Defines a party that can have named arguments, like a function. Parties are the entrypoints into a protocol, they cannot be called in the protocol code (e.g. `alice();`), instead they must be invoked from the command like `./cdsl party <file_name> <party_name> --id <unique_id>`. The `<unique_id>` is a detail that allows multiple instances of the same protocol to run simultaneously. Parties must run with the same `<unique_id>` to communicate.

### Structs/Methods/Impl

```
struct Rectangle {
    length,
    width,
}
```

Defines a struct named `Rectangle` that has two named fields `length` and `width`.

```
x = Rectangle {
    length: 10,
    field2 : 20
};
```

Creates an instance of the `Rectangle` struct and assigns it to `x`. Struct fields can be accessed directly (`x_len = x.length;`).

```
impl Foo {
    def area(self) {
        return self.length * self.width;
    }
    def set_len(self, len) {
        Self.len = len;
    }
}
```

Structs can also define methods inside `impl` blocks, then you can call methods (`x_area = x.area();`).
