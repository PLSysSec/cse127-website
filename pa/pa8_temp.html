# Introduction

In this assignment, you'll implement the client side of four short key exchanges in a domain specific language for writing cryptographic protocols. There are two unique features of this language that you will need to use in this assignment:
1. Parties: protocols can be defined in terms of parties that can send an receive messages. Parties look like functions but begin with the keyword `party` instead of `def`. Parties defined in the same file can communicate by calling `<other_party>.send(value);` and `value = other_party.receive();`. Calls to `send` and `receive` always block until the operation is completed, for instance the previous call to `receive` will block until `<other_party>` sends the currently executing party a message. Likewise the call to `send` will not return until `<other_party>` is executing and can receive the message.

Parties are entrypoints to the protocols they are defined in, and they can by invoked through the command line. **explanation of helper scripts here**.
2. Cryptographic Primitives: Several cryptographic primitives (tools cryptographers use to build up protocols) are built in to the language. Typically, they are defined at the top of the file with the keyword `global`, so that they are in scope for all functions defined in the same file. For example, the starter code makes use of an `AuthenticatedCipher` object which has the following interface:

```
# instantiate a new AuthenticatedCipher
C = AuthenticatedCipher();

# encrypts msg using key
ct = C.encrypt(key, msg);

# decrypts msg using key (msg’ is equivalent to msg)
msg’ = C.decrypt(key, msg);
```

`key` and `msg` can be any value that can be serialized, which means we can pass pretty much anything as these two arguments, you could encrypt an `Integer`, a `String`, a `Tuple`, or even an `AuthenticatedCipher`. This also means that the order of arguments is important, as it is easy to accidentally encrypt the key with the message instead of the other way around (ie. `ct = C.encrypt(msg, key);` is incorrect but may not raise an error).

We have included an appendix at the end of this handout that documents some of the other cryptographic primitives that appear in the starter code, as well as how to write useful language structures like if-statments. The starter code in `prot.cy` also contains example usage of everything you will need to finish the assignment.

# Basic Message Sending

We have given you the code for `server0`, which expects an unencrypted message from the client and returns a response. Implement the corresponding `client0` code so that it prints out the message it receives from the server.

# Basic Asymmetric Encryption

Protocol ver.0 is obvious pretty bad. We're sending messages in the clear, and anyone can snoop on the traffic and see our messages. To deal with this, we're going to use a Diffie-Hellman key exchange to derive a shared key without revealing it to a third party.

Implement the party `client1`. The client should initiate a Diffie-Hellman key exchange with the server and print out the decrypted message it receives.

# Signature Authentication

Protocol ver.1 is better, but it's still susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. In this new version, the server will sign its initial handshake so the client is more certain who it's talking to.

Implement `client2`. The new client must verify the signature sent by the server and print out either `Handshake authenticated!` or `Failed to authenticate!` depending on the result of the signature verification. As before, the client should also print out the decrypted message it receives.

# Verifying with a CA

Protocol ver.2 is slightly better, but the client still implicitly trusts the server's identity. A man-in-the-middle can still impersonate the server. We are now going to fix that. We have provided a party `ca_auth` that acts as a certificate authority (CA). A server generates a certificate by sending its public key to the CA for the CA to sign.

For this part, you will need to do the following:
 1.  Finish implementing the party `server_setup`. This is the code for requesting a new certificate from a CA. Notice that the `server_setup` party writes its public certificate and corresponding secret key to a file for `server3` to use.
 2.  Run `./server_setup.sh` to generate a certificate for the server. This helper script simply runs the `ca_auth` and `server_setup` parties.
 3.  Implement the party `client3`. This client should verify that the server's certificate was indeed signed by the CA **before** it verifies the handshake signature.

This version of the protocol also has both the server and client use an additional _random nonce_ in the handshake to prevent replay attacks.

The client should print out either `Certificate issued by CA.` or `CA did not issue this certificate!` (as well as everything it prints from the previous parts).

# Appendix A: Builtin Functions and Crypto Primitives

## IntMod and Random

```
random_int_mod10 = Random(IntMod(10));
```

`IntMod(n)` takes in an integer and returns the set of integers mod `n`.
`Random(set)` takes in a set of values and returns a random item in the set.
The snippet above uses both functions together to generate a random integer mod
10.

## MultiplicativeCyclicGroup

```
G = MultiplicativeCyclicGroup();
q = G.order;
g = G.generator;
```

A `MultiplicativeCyclicGroup` has two fields, `order`, an integer equal to the
number of elements in the group, and `generator`, a group element.
`MultiplicativeCyclicGroup` also overloads two operators, `*` and `**`.
Specifically, `*` is overloaded for two group elements, and `**` is overloaded
for a group element, and an integer mod the group order. For example, the
following are valid expressions:

```
g_squared = g * g;
ga = g ** Random(IntMod(q));
```

The first line computes the product of the generator with itself, and the second
computes the generator raised to a random integer mod `q`, the group order.

# Appendix B: Syntax Reference

## Assignment

```
<name> = <expression>;
valid = validate(..)
```

Assigns the expression on the right hand side to the variable on the left hand side, creating a new variable if valid is undefined, or updating valid if it has already been defined.

## If Statement

```
if <expression> {
<true_branch>
} else {
    <false_branch>
}

if not valid {
    print(“invalid”);
} else {
    print(“valid”);
}
```

Evaluates the expression after `if` and executes the first branch if it is `true`, and the second (optional) branch if it is `false`.

## Sending/Receiving

```
party alice() {
    bob.send(“hi”);
}

party bob() {
    print(alice.receive());
}
```

Parties are able to communicate by calling `<party_name>.send(..)` and `.. = <party_name>.receive()`, where `<party_name>` is the name of another party defined in the same file. `send` and `receive` are blocking operations, meaning that a protocol may deadlock, for instance if alice and bob both try to send first, instead of alice sending first, and bob receiving first.

## Calling an External Function

```
prot foo;
foo::bar();
```

Protocols can be separated into files and imported with the `prot` keyword. Then you can call functions in an external protocol with the syntax `<prot_name>::<fn_name>(..);`

## Tuple Destructuring

```
party alice() {
    ...
    sig = schnorr::sign(sk, (x, y, z));
    bob.send((sig, x, y, z));
}

party bob() {
    ...
    (sig, x, y, z) = alice.receive();
    valid = schnorr::verify(pk, (x, y, z));
}
```

Multiple values can be grouped into a tuple, which is useful if you want to send a message that has multiple values, or generate a signature over those values. In the snippet above, alice uses `(x, y, z)` to group three variables together into a tuple to be signed, and then sends `(sig, x, y, z)` to bob. Bob destructures the tuple with `(sig, x, y, z) = alice.receive();` so that each item in the tuple can be used later in the protocol.

## Defining a Function

```
def <fn_name>(<arg1>, <arg2>, ...) {
    <fn_body>
}

def validate(material) {
    return material == 123;
}
```

Defines a function with named arguments that can return a value. Variables defined as `global` in the same file are in scope in `<fn_body>`, as well as any other functions or structs defined in that file.

## Defining a Party

```
party <party_name>(<arg1>, <arg2>, ...) {
    <party_body>
}

party alice() {
    bob.send(“hello”);
}
```

Defines a party that can have named arguments, like a function. Parties are the entrypoints into a protocol, they cannot be called in the protocol code (e.g. `alice();`), instead they must be invoked from the command like `./cdsl party <file_name> <party_name> --id <unique_id>`. The `<unique_id>` is a detail that allows multiple instances of the same protocol to run simultaneously. Parties must run with the same `<unique_id>` to communicate.

## Structs/Methods/Impl

```
struct Rectangle {
    length,
    width,
}
```

Defines a struct named `Rectangle` that has two named fields `length` and `width`.

```
x = Rectangle {
    length: 10,
    field2 : 20
};
```

Creates an instance of the `Rectangle` struct and assigns it to `x`. Struct fields can be accessed directly (`x_len = x.length;`).

```
impl Foo {
    def area(self) {
        return self.length * self.width;
    }
    def set_len(self, len) {
        Self.len = len;
    }
}
```

Structs can also define methods inside `impl` blocks, then you can call methods (`x_area = x.area();`).
