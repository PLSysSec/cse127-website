<h2 id="overview">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>A talented but, unfortunately, clumsy student in Nadia's research group
accidentally dropped a flash drive in the campus coffee shop.  You, an
infamously nefarious hacker known far and wide as the archvillain of the
research group, noticed this dropped flash drive, and quickly but
surreptitiously pocketed it.  As usual, you're trying to do everything in your
power to disrupt all of the activities of the research group. Your latest scheme
requires you to get control of the account Nadia uses to access campus networks,
and you have a sneaking suspicion that this dropped flash drive might be just
the foothold you need in order to set your scheme in motion.</p>

<p>Being a smart but cautious hacker, you connected the flash drive to a secure,
isolated machine to inspect its contents.  You don't want a repeat of that one
time when a similar dropped flash drive actually contained a nasty virus and you
ended up having to wipe your machine and reinstall your operating system.  But
this one seems to have nothing suspicious, no traps or hidden surprises.  This
drop seems to actually have been an accident.  Feeling exhilarated, you quickly
email a dump of the flash drive's contents to yourself so you can access it on
your primary machine.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a quick glance shows that there's not much of interest on this
flash drive itself.  You were hoping it might have something juicy, like the
plans for the research group's next super-potent virus.  But all is not lost.
You might still be able to use some of the information on this flash drive to
breach into the research group's super-secret network.  And then who knows what
information you might be able to find just by listening in to what's going
on...</p>

<h2 id="logistics-opening-hints">Logistics and Opening Hints<a class="headerlink" href="#logistics-opening-hints" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>You should have already received the "email to yourself" with the dump of the
dropped flash drive's contents; the email's subject is "flash drive dump".  (If
you don't immediately see it, you may need to check your spam folder.)  That
should be all you need to get started - what interesting things might be here
that would prove useful for your hacking activities?</p>

<p>You'll eventually have to turn in a writeup describing the steps you took to
achieve your goals, so you may want to keep a log as you go in order to make
that easier.</p>

<p>Linux commands you may need to know about or look up for this assignment, in alphabetical order, include:
<ul>
<li>nc</li>
<li>nmap</li>
<li>ssh</li>
<li>tcpdump</li>
<li>wget</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Certain flags of some of these commands may also come in useful, such as
-F, -i, -p, and -X, among others. Information can be found on man pages
(e.g., man nc) or online.</p>

<p>We hope this assignment will be enjoyable and interesting for you.  In order
to preserve the experience for everyone, please be careful with spoilers on
Piazza and in class - part of the fun is finding the relevant information and
figuring out how you're supposed to use it.  As usual, the TA's will be
available in office hours and via private questions on Piazza to provide help
and maybe some hints if necessary.</p>

<p>There are three parts to turn in on Gradescope. A hint for what to turn in
for assignment A is in the PA itself. Assignment B is the discovered token,
and assignment C is a writeup of the steps you took and what tools/flags you used in
the process.</p>

<p>Also, once you breach into the network, you should be able to find a
`README.md` file in the victim's home directory with additional directions and
hints for the next steps.</p>

<p><b>Note: this project is self contained. You should not be actually trying to
access anything outside of this server. If you have questions, please reach out
to the TAs.</b></p>

<p>Good luck in your hacking!</p>
