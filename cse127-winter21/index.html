      <h3>Course Overview</h3>
    <p>This course focuses on computer security, covering a wide range
      of topics on both the <i>defensive</i> and <i>offensive</i> side of this
      field. Among these will be systems security and exploitation
      (e.g., buffer overflows and return-oriented programming),
      sandboxing and isolation, side channels, network security,
      cryptography, privacy and anonymity, and legal and ethical
      issues.  The goal of the course is to provide an appreciation of
      how to think adversarially with respect to computer systems as
      well as an appreciation of how to reason about attacks and
      defenses. </p>

    <p>To complete the projects in this course, you will need to be
      able to write code in C and (some) C++, and have some
      understanding of x86 assembly, JavaScript, PHP and SQL. We will
      not teach these in lecture; you are expected to learn them on
      your own or ask for help in section or office hours. If you
      don't know C,
      K&amp;R's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language">The
      C Programming Language</a> is a go to, but
      the <a href="https://nostarch.com/hacking2.htm">Hacking</a> book
      is probably enough and covers x86 assembly and many of the
      topics in this class.</p>

<h3>Assignments</h3>

<p>We will have six programming assignments. These assignments are meant to both reinforce your knowledge of the concepts covered in lecture and get you to think about security in more depth, beyond what is covered lecture.</p>

<p>You are expected to work on the assignments by yourself. You may discuss the assignments with students from the course in general but not any specific solution. There are no late days, but you will receive an additional 10% if you turn in your assignment by the early date.</p>

    <p>If you consult anything (books, academic papers, internet resources, people) when working on the assignments, note this in your submission. We encourage outside learning but expect you to not seek out specific details about a solution—anything submitted should be considered your own work. Similarly, you are expected to not publish or otherwise share your solutions at any point (even after the class is over). If you are unsure about what is allowed, please ask the course staff.</p>

    <p>By taking this course, you implicitly agree to abide by the UCSD policies on <a href="https://senate.ucsd.edu/Operating-Procedures/Senate-Manual/appendices/2">Integrity of Scholarship</a> and <a href="https://students.ucsd.edu/sponsor/student-conduct/">Student Conduct</a>. See the <a href="https://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu/take-action/covid-19-students.html">Academic Integrity Support for Remote Learning</a>. University rules on integrity of scholarship and code of conduct are taken seriously and will be enforced.</p>

<h3>Scribe Notes</h3>

<p>You will also be tasked with writing a set of lecture notes for one lecture during the quarter, in collaboration with 6 or 7 of your fellow students.  Think of this as a short summary of the lecture, written in complete prose sentences, that should be understandable to a student who missed that class.  There is no perfect textbook for this course, so we will share these scribe notes with your fellow students to help as a study aide.</p>

    <p>Your scribe notes should be written in LaTeX.  The first draft of your notes will be due two weeks from the lecture date.  There is no extra credit for early turn-in, since we expect a few rounds of editing.  You should submit both a PDF version of the notes as well as the source files to Gradescope.  We will give feedback and continue iterating on edits until your notes are in good shape, and then we will post them to Canvas.</p>

    <p>The draft that you turn in should be reasonably polished.  This means that everyone in your group should make copy-editing, clarification, and organizational passes on everyone else's writing so that your notes read as a coherent whole.  If you include images or diagrams that are in the lecture notes that were pulled from another source originally, you should add a citation to that source using bibtex, and your notes will have a bibliography section at the end.  You may also need to refer to some of the readings or other materials to clarify, fix, or fill out additional details about what was covered in lecture; if you do this you should also cite your sources.</p>

<p>As motivational examples, David Wagner from Berkeley has written some beautiful lecture notes for some of the topics covered by this class that are longer than you need to write.  <a href="https://sp20.cs161.org/assets/notes/MemorySafety.1.24.pdf">Here</a> is an example. A more typical example might be <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring08/cos511/scribe_notes/0428.pdf">these</a> scribe notes produced long ago for a random class when your professor was still a student.</p>
