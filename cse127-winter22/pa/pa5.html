            <p>This is a group project; you can work in a team of size at most two and submit one
              project per team. You are not required to work with the same partner on every project.
              You and your partner should collaborate closely on each part.</p>

            <p>You have two late days that you may use to turn in work past the
              deadline over the entire quarter. A late day is a contiguous 24-hour
              period. Both you and your partner will be charged for every late day
              that you use, and you both must have late days to use them. These
              late days are intended to cover your extension needs for usual
              circumstances: brief illness, busy with other classes, interviews,
              travel, extracurricular conflicts, and so on. You do not need to ask
              permission to use a late day.</p>

            <p>The code and other answers you submit must be entirely your team's
              own work. You may discuss the conceptualization of the project and the
              meaning of the questions, but you may not look at any part of someone
              elseâ€™s solution or collaborate with anyone other than your
              partner. You may consult published references, provided that you
              appropriately cite them (e.g., with program comments).</p>

            <p>In this project, we'll start by investigating Vigenere ciphers, then
              move on to investigating vulnerabilities in widely used
              cryptographic hash functions, including length-extension attacks and collision
              vulnerabilities, and an implementation vulnerability in a popular digital
              signature scheme.</p>
            <hr>


            <h2 id="part-1-vigenere-ciphers">Part 1: Vigenere ciphers (4 points)</h2>
            <p>For this problem, solve by hand or write a program (perhaps in Python).</p>
            <p>You can read about how the Vigenere cipher works <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher#Description">on
            Wikipedia</a>. 
            Vigenere ciphers can be generally deciphered using Kasiski Examination, which is
            discussed on the wikipedia page.</p>
            <p>You can find some ciphertext produced with the Vigenere cipher under a certain
            key on Gradescope as the assignment "PA5: Ciphertext".</p>
            <p>We also provided sample code for decrypting ciphertext <a href="assets/decrypt.py">sample decryption code here</a>.</p
            <p>Encrypting a plaintext letter with a key letter <code>A</code> results in no change, encrypting
            with a key letter <code>B</code> results in an increment by one place in the alphabet, encrypting with key letter <code>C</code>
            results in an increment by two places, etc.
            Also assume that the original plaintext contains only uppercase letters (A-Z)
            and no spaces or punctuation.</p>
            <p>For example, encrypting the plaintext: ATTACKATDAWN with the key: BLAISE results in the following ciphertext:</p>
            <table>

            <p><em>Historical note</em>: In November 2019, it was discovered that the security company
            Fortinet was using "XOR encryption with a static key" in some products, which
            is similar to a Vigenere cipher and has similar (lack of) security properties.

          <h2 id="part-2-length-extension">Part 2: Length extension (4 points)</h2>
          <p>For many applications, you should use MACs such as HMAC-SHA256 instead of plain
          cryptographic hash functions (e.g., MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256) because hashes, also
          known as digests, do not provide security against an attacker who can control or modify the hash value.  What we
          really want is something that behaves like a pseudorandom function, which HMAC and other MAC functions
          are constructed to behave like and hash functions alone do not.</p>
          <p>One difference between hash functions and pseudorandom functions is that a collision-resistant hash function
          may still be subject to <em>length extension</em>.  Many common hash functions use a
          design called the Merkle-Damgard construction.  Each is built around a
          <em>compression function</em> <em>f</em> and maintains an internal state <em>s</em>, which is
          initialized to a fixed constant.  Messages are processed in fixed-size blocks
          by applying the compression function to the current state and current block to
          compute an updated internal state, i.e., s_{i+1} = f(s_i, b_i).  The result
          of the final application of the compression function becomes the output of the
          hash function.</p>
          <p>A consequence of this design is that if we know the hash of an <em>n</em>-block
          message, we can find the hash of longer messages by applying the compression
          function for each block b_{n+1}, b_{n+2}, ... that we want to add.  This
          process is called length extension, and it can be used to attack many
          applications of hash functions.</p>

          <h3 id="2a-experimenting">2a. Experimenting</h3>
          <p>To experiment with this idea, we'll use a Python implementation of the MD5 hash
          function, though SHA-1 and SHA-256 are vulnerable to length extension in the
          same way.  You can <a href="assets/pymd5.py">download the <code>pymd5</code> module here</a> and
          learn how to use it by running <code>pydoc pymd5</code>.  To follow
          along with these examples, run Python in interactive mode and run the command
          <code>from pymd5 import md5, padding</code>.</p>
          <p>Consider the string "Use HMAC, not hashes".  We can compute its MD5 hash by
          running:</p>

          <pre><code>
            from pymd5 import md5, padding
            m = "Use HMAC, not hashes"
            h = md5()
            h.update(m)
            print(h.hexdigest())
          </code></pre>
          
          <p>or, more compactly,</p>
          <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">md5</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">m</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">hexdigest</span><span class="p">())</span>
          </pre></div>
          
          
          <p>The output should be <code>3ecc68efa1871751ea9b0b1a5b25004d</code>.</p>
          <p>MD5 processes messages in 512-bit blocks, so internally, the hash function
          pads <em>m</em> to a multiple of that length.  The padding consists of the bit 1,
          followed by as many 0 bits as necessary, followed by a 64-bit count of the
          number of bits in the unpadded message.  (If the 1 and the count won't fit in
          the current block, an additional block is added.)  You can use the function
          <code>padding(count)</code> in the <code>pymd5</code> module to compute the padding that will be
          added to a <em>count</em>-bit message.</p>
          <p>Even if we didn't know <em>m</em>, we could compute the hash of longer messages of the
          general form <code>m + padding(len(m)*8) + suffix</code> by setting the initial internal
          state of our MD5 function to <code>MD5(m)</code>, instead of the default initialization
          value, and setting the function's message length counter to the size of <em>m</em>
          plus the padding (a multiple of the block size).  To find the padded message
          length, guess the length of <em>m</em> and run <code>bits = (length_of_m +
          len(padding(length_of_m * 8))) * 8</code>.</p>
          <p>The <code>pymd5</code> module lets you specify these parameters as additional arguments
          to the <code>md5</code> object:</p>
          <div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">h</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">md5</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">state</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">bytes</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fromhex</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;3ecc68efa1871751ea9b0b1a5b25004d&quot;</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">count</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">512</span><span class="p">)</span>
          </pre></div>
          
          
          <p>Now you can use length extension to find the hash of a longer string that
          appends the suffix "Good advice".  Simply run:</p>
          <pre><code>
            x = "Good advice"
            h.update(x)
            print(h.hexdigest())
          </code></pre>
          
          <p>to execute the compression function over <em>x</em> and output the resulting hash.
          Verify that it equals the MD5 hash of <code>m.encode("utf-8") + padding(len(m)*8) + x.encode("utf-8")</code>. In Python 3, we need to convert <code>m</code>
          and <code>x</code> from strings to bytes so that we can add these to the
          padding, which is a <code>bytes</code> type.
          Notice that, due to the length-extension property of MD5, we didn't need to know
          the value of <code>m</code> to compute the hash of the longer string - all we needed to
          know was <code>m</code>'s length and its MD5 hash.</p>
          <p>This part of the assignment is intended to introduce length extension and
          familiarize you with the Python MD5 module we will be using; you will not
          need to submit anything for it.</p>

          <h3 id="2b-conduct-a-length-extension-attack">2b. Conduct a length extension attack</h3>
          <p>Length extension attacks can cause serious vulnerabilities when people
          try to construct something like a MAC by using <em>hash(secret
              || message)</em> using a hash function like MD5, SHA1, or SHA2, that is vulnerable to length extension.
	    (SHA3, unlike SHA-256, SHA1, and MD5, uses a different construction and is not vulnerable to length extension attacks, so <em>SHA3(secret || message)</em> <i>is</i> a secure MAC.  This is why cryptography is hard.)</p>
	  <p>The National Bank of CSE 127, which is not up-to-date on
          its security practices, hosts an API that allows its client-side applications
          to perform actions on behalf of a user by loading URLs of the form:</p>
          <p><code>http://bank.cse127.ucsd.edu/pa5/api?token=d6613c382dbb78b5592091e08f6f41fe&amp;user=nadiah&amp;command1=ListSquirrels&amp;command2=NoOp</code></p>
          <p>where <code>token</code> is MD5(<em>user's 8-character password</em> || <code>user=...</code> <em>[the rest of
          the decoded URL starting from user= and ending with the last command]</em>).</p>
          <p>Using the techniques that you learned in the previous section and without
          guessing the password, apply length extension to create a URL ending with
          <code>&amp;command3=UnlockAllSafes</code> that would be treated as valid by the server API.</p>
          <p><em>Note</em>: Because of its bad security practices, the National Bank of CSE 127 has 
          taken down its website. So you'll have to use gradescope to test if your attack
          URL would work.</p>
          <p><em>Hint</em>: You might want to use the <code>quote()</code> function from Python's <code>urllib.parse</code>
          module to encode non-ASCII characters in the URL.</p>
          <p><em>Historical fact</em>: In 2009, security researchers found that the API used by
          the photo-sharing site Flickr suffered from a length-extension vulnerability
          almost exactly like the one in this exercise.</p>
          <p><strong>What to submit</strong> A Python 3.x script named <code>len_ext_attack.py</code> that:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>Accepts a valid URL in the same form as the one above as a command line argument.</li>
          <li>Modifies the URL so that it will execute the <code>UnlockAllSafes</code> command as the user.</li>
          <li>Prints the new URL to the command line.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>You should make the following assumptions:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>
          <p>The input URL will have the same form as the sample above, but we may change the
          server hostname and the values of <code>token</code>, <code>user</code>, <code>command1</code>, and <code>command2</code>.
          These values may be of substantially different lengths than in the sample.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>The input URL may be for a user with a different password, but the length of the
          password will be unchanged.</p>
          </li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can base your code on the following example:</p>
          <pre><code>
            import sys, urllib.parse
            from pymd5 import md5, padding
            url = sys.argv[1]
            
            # Your code to modify url goes here

          <p>MD5 was once the most widely used cryptographic hash function, but today it is

          <p>In 2004, Wang's method took more than 5 hours to find a collision on a desktop
          PC.  Since then, researchers have introduced vastly more efficient collision

          <h3 id="3b-a-hash-collision-attack">3b. A hash collision attack</h3>
          <p>The collision attack lets us generate two messages with the same MD5 hash and
          any chosen (identical) prefix.  Due to MD5's length-extension behavior, we can
          append any suffix to both messages and know that the longer messages will also
          collide.  This lets us construct files that differ only in a binary "blob" in
          the middle and have the same MD5 hash, i.e. <em>prefix</em> || <em>blobA</em> || <em>suffix</em>
          and <em>prefix</em> || <em>blobB</em> || <em>suffix</em>.</p>
          <p>We can leverage this to create two programs (shell scripts) that have identical
          MD5 hashes but wildly different behaviors.  We're using shell scripts, but this
          could be done using a program in almost any language.  Put the following two
          lines into a file called <code>prefix</code>:</p>

          <pre><code>
            #!/bin/bash
            cat << "EOF" | openssl dgst -sha256 > DIGEST
          </code></pre>
          
          <p>and put these four lines (starting with a blank line) into a file called <code>suffix</code>:</p>
          <pre><code>
            EOF
            digest=$(cat DIGEST | sed 's/(stdin)= //' )
            echo "The sha256 digest is $digest"
          </code></pre>
          
          <p>Now use <code>fastcoll</code> to generate two files with the same MD5 hash that both begin
          with <code>prefix</code>. (<code>fastcoll -p prefix -o col1 col2</code>.)  Then append the suffix to both
          (<code>cat col1 suffix &gt; file1.sh; cat col2 suffix &gt; file2.sh</code>).  Verify that <code>file1.sh</code>
          and <code>file2.sh</code> have the same MD5 hash but generate different output.</p>
          <p>Extend this technique to produce another pair of programs, <code>good</code> and <code>evil</code>, that
          also share the same MD5 hash.  One program should execute a benign payload: echo
          or print <code>"I mean no harm."</code> The second should execute a pretend malicious payload:
          echo or print <code>"You are doomed!"</code></p>
          <p><strong>What to submit</strong> Two scripts, <code>good</code> and <code>evil</code>, that have the same MD5 hash, have
          different SHA-256 hashes, and print the specified messages.</p>

          <h2 id="part-4-rsa-signature-forgery">Part 4: RSA signature forgery (4 points)</h2>
          <p>A secure implementation of RSA encryption or digital signatures requires a
          proper padding scheme.  RSA without padding, also known as <em>textbook RSA</em>,
          has several undesirable properties. For example, it is trivial for an attacker
          with only an RSA public key pair <em>(n,e)</em> to produce a mathematically valid
          message, signature pair by choosing an <em>s</em> and returning <em>(s^e, s)</em>.</p>
          <p>In order to prevent an attacker from being able to forge valid signatures in
          this way, RSA implementations use a padding scheme to provide structure to the
          messages that are encrypted or signed.  The most commonly used padding scheme
          in practice is defined by the PKCS #1 v1.5 standard, which can be found at
          <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2313">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2313</a>.
          The standard defines, among other things, the format of RSA keys and signatures
          and the procedures for generating and validating RSA signatures.</p>

          <h3 id="4a-validating-rsa-signatures">4a. Validating RSA signatures</h3>
          <p>You can experiment with validating RSA signatures yourself.  Create a file called
          <code>key.pub</code> that contains the following RSA public key:</p>
          <pre><code>
            -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
            MFowDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEBBQADSQAwRgJBALB8X0rLPrfgAfXMW73LjKYb5V9QG5LU
            DrmsA9CAittsLvh2c082wHwVyCIiWQ8S3AA/jfW839sFN4zAZkW2S3cCAQM=
            -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
          </code></pre>
          
          
          <p>You can view the modulus and public exponent of this key by running:</p>
          <pre> <code>openssl rsa -in key.pub -pubin -text -noout</code> </pre>
          
          <p>Create a file containing only the text <code>CSE 127 rul3z!</code>.</p>
          <pre> <code>echo -n 'CSE 127 rul3z!' > message</code> </pre>
          
          <p>The following is a base64-encoded signature of the file <code>message</code> using the public
          key above.</p>
          <pre> <code> RaHHC2E0qm1sauuhlV3KBGiaTb5IGmaaNFQn22ykTSu88EIBkBG48gjiamc3l+4HJYUwpZDefcT2dLPyaOHA/w== </code> </pre>
          
          <p>Convert this signature into a binary file:</p>
          <pre> <code>base64 -d -i sig.b64 > sig</code> </pre>
          
          
          <p>Now verify the signature against the file you created.</p>
          <pre> <code>openssl dgst -sha1 -verify key.pub -signature sig message</code> </pre>
          
          <p>We can also use basic math operations in Python to explore this signature further.
          Remember, RSA ciphertexts, plaintexts, exponents, moduli, and signatures are actually
          all integers.</p>
          <p>Open a Python shell and run the following commands to import the signature as an integer:</p>

          <pre><code>
              from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
              from Crypto.Hash import SHA
              signature = int(open('sig', 'rb').read().hex(), 16)
          </code></pre>
          
          
          <p>Next, import the public key file that you created earlier:</p>
          <pre><code>pubkey = RSA.importKey(open('key.pub').read())</code></pre>
          
          <p>The modulus and exponent are then accessible as <code>pubkey.n</code> and <code>pubkey.e</code>, respectively.
          Now reverse the signing operation and examine the resulting value in hex:</p>
          <pre><code>"{:0128x}".format(pow(signature, pubkey.e, pubkey.n))</code></pre>
          
          <p>You should see something like <code>'0001fffff ... 22c1422dac3c4e5fdd87040b3fb156acd3d83d1f'</code>
          Verify that the last 20 bytes of this value match the SHA-1 hash of your file:</p>
          <pre><code>SHA.new(b"CSE 127 rul3z!").hexdigest()</code></pre>
          
          
          <p>You don't need to submit anything for this part.</p>

          <h3 id="4b-pkcs-1-v15-signature-padding">4b. PKCS #1 v1.5 signature padding</h3>
          <p>The signed value you examined in the previous section had been padded using the
          PKCS #1 v1.5 signature scheme.  PKCS #1 v1.5 padding for RSA signatures is
          structured as follows: one <code>00</code> byte, one <code>01</code> byte, some
          <code>FF</code> bytes, another <code>00</code> byte, some special ASN.1 bytes denoting
          which hash algorithm was used to compute the hash digest, then the bytes of the
          hash digest itself. The number of <code>FF</code> bytes varies such that the size
          of <em>m</em> is equal to the size of the RSA key.</p>
          <p>A <em>k</em>-bit RSA key used to sign a SHA-1 hash digest will generate the following
          padded value of <em>m</em>:</p>
          <pre><code>
            00 01 FF...FF 00 3021300906052B0E03021A05000414 XX...XX
                  ^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^
              k/8 - 38 bytes wide         ||            20-byte SHA-1 digest
                                  ASN.1 "magic" bytes
          </code></pre>
          
          
          <p>When PKCS padding is used, it is important for implementations to verify that
          every bit of the padded, signed message is exactly as it should be.  It is
          tempting for an implementer to validate the signature by first stripping off
          the <code>00 01</code> bytes, then some number of padding <code>FF</code> bytes, then
          <code>00</code>, and then parse the ASN.1 and verify the hash.  If the
          implementation does not check the length of the <code>FF</code> bytes and that the
          hash is in the least significant bits of the message, then it is possible for
          an attacker to forge values that pass this validation check.</p>
          <p>This possibility is particularly troubling for signatures generated with <em>e =
          3</em>. If the length of the required padding, ASN.1 bytes, and hash value is
          significantly less than <em>n^{1/3}</em> then an attacker can construct a cube root
          over the integers whose most significant bits will validate as a correct
          signature, ignoring the actual key.  To construct a "signature" that will
          validate against such implementations, an attacker simply needs to construct an
          integer whose most significant bytes have the correct format, including the
          hashed message, pad the remainder of this value with zeros or other garbage
          that will be ignored by the vulnerable implementation, and then take a cube
          root over the integers, rounding as appropriate.</p>

          to be vulnerable to this attack, including OpenSSL.  In 2014, the Mozilla
          library NSS was found to be vulnerable to this type of attack:
