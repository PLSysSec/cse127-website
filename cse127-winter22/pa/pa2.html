                        <p>This is a group project; you can work in a team of size at most two
                            and submit one project per team. You are not required to work with the
                            same partner on every project. You and your partner should
                            collaborate closely on each part.</p>

                        <p>You have two late days that you may use to turn in work past the
                            deadline over the entire quarter. A late day is a contiguous 24-hour
                            period. Both you and your partner will be charged for every late day
                            that you use, and you both must have late days to use them. These late
                            days are intended to cover your extension needs for usual
                            circumstances: brief illness, busy with other classes, interviews,
                            travel, extracurricular conflicts, and so on. You do not need to ask
                            permission to use a late day.</p>

                        <p>The code and other answers you submit must be entirely your team's own
                            work. You may discuss the conceptualization of the project and the
                            meaning of the questions, but you may not look at any part of someone
                            else’s solution or collaborate with anyone other than your
                            partner. You may consult published references, provided that you
                            appropriately cite them (e.g., with program comments).</p>

                        <p>Solutions must be submitted to Gradescope.</p>

                        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>The goal of this assignment is to gain hands-on experience exploiting side
                            channels. This assignment will demonstrate how side channels can be just as
                            dangerous as the control flow vulnerabilities you exploited in PA 1.</p>

                        <p>You will be provided a two skeleton files (<code>memhack.c</code> and
                            <code>timehack.c</code>) that you will use to exploit side channels present in a
                            target library (<code>sysapp.c</code>) to obtain a protected key. You may consult
                            any online references you wish. You must document sources you used in
                            your solutions, for example with program comments. Failure to do so
                            will be considered a violation of the academic integrity policy.

                        <p>This project asks you to develop attacks and test them in a virtual
                            machine you control. Attempting the same kinds of attacks against
                            others’ systems without authorization is prohibited by law and
                            university policies and may result in <em>fines, expulsion, and jail time</em>.
                            <strong>You must not attack anyone else’s system without
                                authorization!</strong> You are required to respect the privacy and

                        <p>Just like PA1, for this assignment you will be provided with a
                            VirtualBox VM containing all the files you need. You can download the VM image
                            <a
                                href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YZGD86nx5bzFqQoxQ0pLEZ36MHZMs7jg?usp=sharing">here</a>.
                            As in PA1, download <a
                                href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j0aEiwCmxBI8Y64pdLnEEDoqUlt_4UfX/view?usp=sharing">CSE127-PA2-VBOX.zip</a>
                            if VirtualBox is compatible with your machine; download <a
                                href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ndyAsYrKjU2OMBCGBRRHKrlDzLzTrONl/view?usp=sharing">CSE127-PA2-UTM.zip</a>
                            if you are using an M1 Mac (Intel Macs can use either VM software).
                        </p>

                        <p>

                            Make sure to import the <code>pa2box.vbox</code> file into VirtualBox via the
                            <code>Machine</code>
                            → <code>Add</code> menu item; <em class="asterisk">don't</em> create a brand-new VirtualBox
                            VM or import the
                            <code>pa2box-data.vmdk</code> file on its own: If you do this, you won't have the correct
                            configuration.

                        </p>

                        <p>

                            The VM is configured with two users: <code>student</code>, with password
                            <code>hacktheplanet</code>;
                            and <code>root</code>, with password <code>hackallthethings</code>. We recommend you use the
                            VM via
                            <code>ssh</code> and <code>scp</code>, just like previous assignments. Please note that SSH
                            is
                            disabled for <code>root</code>, so you can only SSH in as the <code>student</code> user.

                        </p>

                        <p>

                            SSH is listening on port <code>2222</code>, i.e.
                        </p>

                        <pre
                            class="listing backtick"><code><span class="line"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">ssh</span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag">-p</span> 2222 <span class="hljs-selector-tag">student</span><span class="hljs-keyword">@localhost</span></span></code></pre>

                        <p>

                            You can still log in as <code>root</code> using <code>su</code> or by logging into the VM
                            directly, i.e.
                        </p>

                        <pre
                            class="listing backtick"><code><span class="line">student@CSE127<span class="hljs-symbol">:~</span>$ su root</span></code></pre>

                        <p>

                            You can redownload the starter code <a

                            Starter files are included inside the <code>student</code> user's home directory within the
                            VM image.

                        <p>

                            There are two parts to this assignment, each with its own subdirectory,
                            <code>memhack</code> and <code>timehack</code>. Each subdirectory contains exploit starter
                            code
                            (<code>memhack.c</code> or <code>timehack.c</code>), which imports a library
                            (<code>sysapp.c</code>, with the
                            same contents across the two subdirectories) with password-checking
                            functionality vulnerable to side-channel attacks. You should <em class="asterisk">not</em>
                            modify
                            <code>sysapp.c</code>, only <code>memhack.c</code> and <code>timehack.c</code>. Each
                            subdirectory contains a
                            <code>Makefile</code> for building your exploits, i.e. run <code>make</code> or
                            <code>make clean</code> if desired.

                        </p>

                        <h3 id="assignment-instructions">Assignment Instructions</h3>

                        <p> You will be writing two exploits, each of which takes advantage of a side
                            channel, to obtain the password in <code>sysapp.c</code>. In <code>memhack.c</code>, you
                            will exploit
                            a memory-based side channel, and in <code>timehack.c</code> you will exploit a
                            timing-based side channel. See Section 2 for specific details. Once both of
                            your exploits can determine the password stored in <code>correct_pass</code> in
                            <code>sysapp.c</code> and call the
                            <code>hack_system()</code> function successfully, the assignment is complete.
                        </p>

                        <p> Additionally, for each exploit, provide a brief description of how it works in
                            its corresponding <code>writeup-X.txt</code> file. </p>

                        <h3 id="memory-based-side-channel">Memory-Based Side Channel</h3>

                        <p>


                            We recommend you start with the memory-based side channel because it is
                            deterministic and doesn't have problems with noise. Look at the <code>check_pass()</code>
                            function in <code>sysapp.c</code> and note two things:

                        </p>
                        <ol start="1">
                            <li class="number">The password string is passed by reference
                            </li>
                            <li class="number">The memory it points to is checked against the reference password one
                                character at a time.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>

                            Now look in <code>memhack.c</code> and note how a buffer is allocated such that the page
                            starting at <code>page_start</code> is protected (i.e., accessing it will caused a
                            segmentation fault, or SEGV) and the previous 32 characters are allocated.

                        </p>
                        <p>

                            Now look at the demonstration function <code>demonstrate_signals()</code>, which shows how
                            referencing any memory in the protected page will produce a fault. Also observe
                            how the function catches that fault. You do not need to use this function;
                            it is merely there to show you how to use signals to capture whether a memory
                            reference touched a page or not.

                        </p>
                        <p>

                            Now you will want to create a framework (in <code>memhack.c</code>) to call
                            <code>check_pass()</code>
                            with different inputs and catching any resulting faults so you can determine if
                            part of the password is correct. We suggest a loop over the maximum password
                            size (32 characters) where for the first guess you store the password such that
                            its first character is one byte before page start and then iterate between
                            possible choices for the first character (when you get it right you will get a
                            page fault). Repeat this to guess the entire password. Note that all ASCII
                            symbols from ASCII symbol 33 (<code>!</code>) to ASCII symbol 126 (<code>∼</code>) can be
                            used in the password.
                            Other hints:

                        </p>
                        <ol start="1">
                            <li class="number">You are already given a page protected buffer with enough memory to crack
                                the password. All you need to do is use it appropriately for each guess you make.
                            </li>
                            <li class="number">The <code>demonstrate_signals</code> function handles all the segfaults
                                for you. You

                        </h4>

                        <p>We <strong>highly advise</strong> reading the man pages for
                            <code>sigsetjmp</code>/<code>siglongjmp</code> so you
                            understand how they work.

                        <p>

                            One frequent pitfall students run into is calling <code>sigsetjmp</code> inside of a helper
                            function, which can cause undefined behavior (especially when running on Gradescope).

                        </p>

                        <p>An excerpt from <code>man sigsetjmp</code>:</p>
                        <pre>   If the function which called setjmp() returns before longjmp() is called, the behavior is undefined. Some kind of subtle or unsubtle chaos is sure to result.</pre>

                        <h3 id="timing-based-side-channel">Timing-Based Side Channel</h3>

                        <p>


                            Unlike the memory-based side channel, the timing-based side channel will deal
                            with noise. Go back and look at <code>check_pass()</code>. An artificial delay has been
                            added when each character is checked to make your life easier (it’s possible to
                            do the assignment without it but it would require a much more careful
                            methodology). The execution time of <code>check_pass()</code> depends on how many
                            characters you guess <strong class="asterisk">correctly</strong>.

                        </p>

                        <p>

                            Look in <code>timehack.c</code> and find a macro there for a function called
                            <code>rdtsc()</code>
                            which invokes the processors cycle counter (a clock that increments by one for
                            each processor cycle that passes). In general, treat <code>rdtsc()</code> as a free
                            running timer that returns a <code>long</code>. Insert a call to <code>rdtsc()</code> before
                            the call
                            to <code>check_pass()</code> and afterwards. Print the difference between these values to
                            see how long (in cycles) the password checking ran. Run the program a few
                            times. Now change the guess string so the first character is correct. Run again
                            and see how the time difference changes.

                        </p>

                        <p>

                            Now automate this entire process, in the style of the original approach in
                            <code>memhack.c</code>. Note that unlike the <code>memhack</code> attack, the
                            <code>timehack</code> problem will
                            have to deal with <strong class="asterisk">noise</strong>. Depending on things like what
                            other programs are
                            running, the status of the cache, the contents of the branch target buffer,
                            etc... there can be significant variability in the amount of time each check
                            takes. This <strong class="asterisk">will</strong> matter in practice. You will want to run
                            a lot of trials
                            before you reach your conclusion about each character. Other hints:
