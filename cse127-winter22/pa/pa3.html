                    <p>This is a group project; you can work in a team of size at most two and submit one
                        project per team. You are not required to work with the same partner on every project.
                        You and your partner should collaborate closely on each part.</p>

                    <p>You have two late days that you may use to turn in work past the
                        deadline over the entire quarter. A late day is a contiguous 24-hour
                        period. Both you and your partner will be charged for every late day
                        that you use, and you both must have late days to use them. These
                        late days are intended to cover your extension needs for usual
                        circumstances: brief illness, busy with other classes, interviews,
                        travel, extracurricular conflicts, and so on. You do not need to ask
                        permission to use a late day.</p>

                    <p>The code and other answers you submit must be entirely your team's
                        own work. You may discuss the conceptualization of the project and the
                        meaning of the questions, but you may not look at any part of someone
                        else’s solution or collaborate with anyone other than your
                        partner. You may consult published references, provided that you
                        appropriately cite them (e.g., with program comments).</p>

                    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
                    <p>A startup named <b>BUNGLE!</b> is about to launch its first product—a web search engine—but their
                        investors are nervous about security problems. Unlike the Bunglers who developed the site, you
                        took CSE 127, so the investors have hired you to perform a security evaluation before it goes
                        live.
                        <b>BUNGLE!</b> is available for you to test at https://bungle.sysnet.ucsd.edu/.</p>

                    <p>In addition to providing search results, the site accepts logins and tracks users’ search
                        histories. It stores usernames, passwords, and search history in a database.</p>

                    <p><b>Note: Passwords used on the BUNGLE! site may be used, in whole or in part, in subsequent
                        assignments in the course. Never use an important password to test an insecure site! This
                        especially includes your personal passwords.</b></p>
                    <p>Before being granted access to the source code, you reverse engineered the site and determined
                        that it replies to five main URLs: /, /search, /login, /logout, and /create. The function of
                        these URLs is explained below, but if you want an additional challenge, you can skip the rest of
                        this section and do the reverse engineering yourself.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h5>Main page (/) </h5>

                        <p class="tab">
                            The main page accepts GET requests and displays a search form. When submitted, this
                            form issues a GET request to /search, sending the search string as the parameter “q”.
                            If no user is logged in, the main page also displays a form that gives the user the option
                            of
                            logging in or creating an account. The form issues POST requests to /login and /create.

                            The search results page accepts GET requests and prints the
                            search string, supplied
                            in the “q” query parameter, along with the search results. If the user is logged in, the
                            page
                            also displays the user’s recent search history in a sidebar.

                            The login handler accepts POST requests and takes plaintext “username”
                            and “password” query parameters. It checks the user database to see if a user with those
                            credentials exists. If so, it sets a login cookie and redirects the browser to the main
                            page.
                            The cookie tracks which user is logged in; manipulating or forging it is not part of this
                            project.

                        The logout handler accepts POST requests. It deletes the login cookie,

                        the database of users, unless a user with that username already exists. It then logs the user in
                        and redirects the browser to the main page.

                            will
                            not guess, but again, never use an important password to test an insecure site!

                <h3>Defense Levels</h3>
                <p>The Bunglers have been experimenting with some naïve defenses, so you also need to demonstrate that
                    these provide insufficient protection. In Parts 2 and 3, the site includes drop-down menus at the
                    top of each page that let you change the CSRF and XSS defenses that are in use. When you are testing
                    your solution, ensure that <b>BUNGLE!</b> has the correct defense levels set.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may not attempt to subvert the mechanism for changing the level of defense in your attacks. Be
                    sure to test your solutions with the appropriate defense levels! Additionally, be sure to include
                    the defense levels as url parameters in any request to bungle!
                </p>
                <p>
                    In all parts, you should implement the simplest attack you can think of that defeats the given set
                    of
                    defenses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In other words, do not simply attack the highest level of defense and submit that attack as
                    your solution for all defenses. You do not need to combine the vulnerabilities, unless explicitly
                    stated.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Firefox and Chrome web developer tools will be very helpful for this project, particularly
                    the JavaScript console and debugger, DOM inspector, and network monitor. See https://
                    developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools and https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools.
                    Note
                    that you may complete the project on any web browser of your choice, but we have only tested that it
                    works on Chrome and Firefox.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Although general purpose tools are permitted, you are not allowed to use tools that are designed to
                    automatically test for vulnerabilities.

                    Your solutions will involve manipulating SQL statements and writing web code using HTML, JavaScript,
                    and
                    the jQuery library. You should search the web for answers to basic how-to questions. There are many
                    fine
                    online resources for learning these tools. Here are a few that we recommend:

        <h2>Part 1: SQL Injection</h2>

        <p>
            Your first goal is to demonstrate SQL injection attacks that log you in as an arbitrary user without knowing
            the password. In order to protect other students’ accounts, we’ve made a series of separate login forms for
            you to attack that aren’t part of the main BUNGLE! site.
        </p>
        <p>
            For each of the following defenses, provide inputs to the target login form that successfully log you in as
            the user “victim”:
        </p>
        <h3>1.0 No defenses</h3>
        <p><b>Target</b>: https://bungle.sysnet.ucsd.edu/sqlinject0 </p>
        <p><b>Submission</b>: sql_0.txt </p>
        <h3>1.1 Simple escaping</h3>
        <p>
            The server escapes single quotes (') in the inputs by replacing them with two single quotes.
        </p>
        <p><b>Target</b>: https://bungle.sysnet.ucsd.edu/sqlinject1</p>
        <p><b>Submission</b>: sql_1.txt</p>
        <h3>1.2 Escaping and Hashing [Extra Credit] </h3>
        <p>
            The server uses the following PHP code, which escapes the username and applies the MD5 hash function to the
            password.
        </p>
        <pre>
if (isset($_POST['username']) and isset($_POST['password'])) {
    $username = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['username']);
    $password = md5($_POST['password'], true);
    $sql_s = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='$username' and pw='$password'";
    $rs = mysql_query($sql_s);
    if (mysql_num_rows($rs) > 0) {
        echo "Login successful!";
    } else {
        echo "Incorrect username or password";
    }
}
        </pre>
        <p>
            This is more difficult than the previous two defenses. You will need to write a program to produce a working
            exploit. You can use any language you like, but we recommend Python 3.
        </p>
        <p><b>Target</b>: https://bungle.sysnet.ucsd.edu/sqlinject2</p>
        <p><b>Submission</b>: sql_2.txt, sql_2-src directory (see below for specification)</p>
        <h3>1.3 The SQL [Extra credit]</h3>

        <p>
            This target uses a different database. Your job is to use SQL injection to retrieve:
        <ul>
            <li>
                The name of the database
            </li>
            <li>
                The version of the SQL server
            </li>
            <li>
                All of the names of the tables in the database (d) A secret string hidden in the database
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Target: https://bungle.sysnet.ucsd.edu/sqlinject3</b></p>
        <p><b>Submission</b>: sql_3.txt</p>

        <p>
            For this part, the text file you submit should start with a list of all the queries you made to learn the
            answers. Follow this with the values specified above, using this format:
        </p>
        <pre>
QUERY
QUERY
QUERY
...
Name: DB name
Version: DB version string
Tables: comma separated names
Secret: secret string
        </pre>
        <h3>What to submit</h3>
        <p>
            When you successfully log in as a victim, the server will provide a
            URL-encoded version of your form inputs. Submit a text file with the specified filename containing only this
            line.
        <p>
            <em>Remember, you must log in as "victim".</em>
        <p>
        </p>
        For 1.2, also submit the source code for the program you wrote by placing it in the directory sql_2-src.
        <p>
            For 1.3, submit a text file as specified.

        <h2>Part 2: Cross-site Scripting (XSS) </h2>

        <p>
            Your next task is to demonstrate XSS attacks against the <b>BUNGLE!</b> search box, which does not properly
            filter search terms before echoing them to the results page.
        </p>
        <p>
            For each of the defenses below, your goal is to construct a URL that, when loaded in the victim’s browser,
            correctly executes the specified payload. We recommend that you begin by testing with a simple payload
            (e.g., alert(0);), then move on to the full payload. Note that you should be able to implement the payload
            once, then use different means of encoding it to bypass the different defenses.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>
                Note: jQuery is embedded on Bungle. Please do not reload it in your scripts for Part 2.
            </b>
        </p>
        <h3>Payload</h3>

        <p>The payload (the code that the attack tries to execute) will be to steal the username and the most recent
            search
            the real user has performed on the <b>BUNGLE!</b> site.
        </p>
        <p>
            When a victim visits the URL you create, these stolen items
            should be sent to the attacker’s server for collection.
            For purposes of grading, your attack should report these events by loading the URL (performing a GET
            request):
            <code>http://localhost:31337/?stolen_user=username&last_search=last_search</code>
        <p>
            We have provided the file <a href="assets/xss_server.py">xss_server.py</a> to help you test your solution.
            You can test receiving this data by running this command at the shell in your project directory:
            <code>python3 xss_server.py</code>.
        </p>
        <p>You should be able to observe the HTTP GET request that your payload generates in the server log.</p>

        <h3>Defenses</h3>
        <p>
            There are five levels of defense. In each case, you should submit the simplest attack you can find that
            works
            against that defense; you should not simply attack the highest level and submit your solution for that level
            for
            every level. Try to use a different technique for each defense. The Python
            code that implements each defense is shown below, along with the target URL and the filename you should
            submit.
        </p>
        <h4>2.0 No defenses</h4>
        <p><b>Target</b>: https://bungle.sysnet.ucsd.edu/search?xssdefense=0 </p>
        <p><b>Submission</b>: xss_0.txt </p>
        <p>
            For 2.0 only, also submit a human-readable version of your payload code (as opposed to the form encoded into
            the
            URL). Save it in a file named xss_payload.html.
        </p>
        <h4>2.1 Remove “script”</h4>
        <code> filtered = re.sub(r"(?i)script", "", input) </code>
        <p><b>Target</b>: https://bungle.sysnet.ucsd.edu/search?xssdefense=1 </p>
        <p><b>Submission</b>: xss_1.txt </p>


        <h4>2.2 Remove several tags</h4>
        <code>
            filtered = re.sub(r&quot;(?i)script|&lt;img|&lt;body|&lt;style|&lt;meta|&lt;embed|&lt;object&quot;,
            &quot;&quot;, input)
        </code>
        <p><b>Target</b>: https://bungle.sysnet.ucsd.edu/search?xssdefense=2 </p>
        <p><b>Submission</b>: xss_2.txt </p>

        <h4>2.3 Remove some punctuation</h4>
        <code>filtered = re.sub(r"[;'\"]", "", input)</code>
        <p><b>Target</b>: https://bungle.sysnet.ucsd.edu/search?xssdefense=3</p>
        <p><b>Submission</b>: xss_3.txt </p>

        <h4>2.4 Encode < and > [Extra credit]</h4>
        <code>filtered = input.replace("<", "&amp;lt;").replace(">", "&amp;gt;")</code>
        <p><b>Target</b>: https://bungle.sysnet.ucsd.edu/search?xssdefense=4</p>
        <p><b>Submission</b>: xss_4.txt </p>
        <p>
            This challenge is hard. We think it requires finding a 0-day vuln or a bug in our code.
        </p>

        <h3>What to submit</h3>
        <p>
            Your submission for each level of defense will be a text file with the specified filename that
            contains a single line consisting of a URL (also submit the readable file for 2.0 only).
            When this URL is loaded in a victim’s browser, it should execute
            the
            specified payload against the specified target. The payload encoded in your URLs may embed inline
            JavaScript.
        </p>

        <hr/>
        <h2>Part 3. Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)</h2>
        <p>
            Your final goal is to demonstrate CSRF vulnerabilities against the login form, and <b>BUNGLE!</b> has
            provided two variations of their implementation for you to test. Your goal is to construct attacks that
            surreptitiously cause the victim to log in to an account you control, thus allowing you to monitor the
            victim’s search queries by viewing the search history for this account.
        </p>
        <p>
            For each of the defenses below, create an HTML file that, when opened by a victim, logs their browser into
            <b>BUNGLE!</b> under the account “attacker” and password “l33th4x”.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>
                Note: the first character of the
                password is a
                letter, not a number.
            </b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Your solutions should not display evidence of an attack; the browser should just display a blank page. (If
            the victim later visits <b>BUNGLE!</b>, it will say “logged in as attacker”, but that’s fine for purposes of
            the
            project. After all, most users won’t immediately notice.)
        </p>
        <h3>
            3.0 No defenses
        </h3>
        <p><b>Target</b>: https://bungle.sysnet.ucsd.edu/search?csrfdefense=0&xssdefense=4</p>
        <p><b>Submission</b>: csrf_0.html </p>

        <h3>3.1 Token validation</h3>
        <p>
            The server sets a cookie named csrf_token to a random 16-byte value and also includes this value as a hidden
            field in the login form. When the form is submitted, the server verifies that the client’s cookie matches
            the
            value in the form. You are allowed to exploit the XSS vulnerability from Part 2 to accomplish your goal.
        </p>
        <p><b>Target</b>: https://bungle.sysnet.ucsd.edu/search?csrfdefense=1&xssdefense=0</p>
        <p><b>Submission</b>: csrf_1.html </p>

        <h3>3.2 Token validation, without XSS [Extra credit]</h3>
        <p>Accomplish the same task as in 3.1 without using XSS.</p>
        <p><b>Target</b>: https://bungle.sysnet.ucsd.edu/search?csrfdefense=1&xssdefense=4</p>
        <p><b>Submission</b>: csrf_2.html </p>

        <p>
            This challenge is hard. We think it requires finding a 0-day vuln or a bug in our code.
        </p>

        <h3>What to submit</h3>
        <p>
            For each part, submit an HTML file with the given name that accomplishes the specified attack
            against the specified target URL. The HTML files you submit may embed inline JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>
                Note: Since you’re sharing the attacker account with other students, we’ve hard-coded it so the search
                history
                won’t actually update. You can test with a different account you create to see the history change.
            </b>
